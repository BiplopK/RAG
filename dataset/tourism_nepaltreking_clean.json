    "content": "Nepal is a landlocked country in the Himalayas in South Asia . It has eight of the world's 10 highest peaks, including Mount Everest , the world's tallest, on the border with Tibet , as well as Lumbini , the birthplace of Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism. Originally a monarchy for two centuries, Nepal has been ruled under a republic since 2008.\nNepal is divided into 7 provinces and 77 districts for administrative purposes, but Wikivoyage uses the divisions below, based on the country's elevation, which are more useful for travellers. From north to south:\nLocked between the snow peaks of the Himalayas and the seething Ganges plain, Nepal has long been home to wandering ascetics and tantric yogis. Consequently, the country has a wealth of sacred sites and natural wonders:\nThese are also important geographic divisions. The Mahabharat Range is a major hydrologic barrier in Nepal and other parts of the Himalaya. South-flowing rivers converge in candelabra shapes to break through this range in a few narrow gorges.  Travel is usually easier within these candelabra drainage systems than between them, so high divides between river systems became historically important political, linguistic and cultural boundaries.\nThe Karnali system in the far west is the birthplace of Pahari ('hill') culture. It was settled by people called the Khas , speaking an Indo-European language called Khaskura ('Khas talk') that was related to other north Indian languages and all claiming descent from classical Sanskrit .\nEast of the Karnali proper, along a major tributary called the Bheri and further east in another basin called the Rapti lived a Tibeto-Burman people called Kham .  Khas and Kham people seem to have been allies and probably intermarried to create the synthesis of aryan and mongoloid features that especially characterizes the second-highest Chhetri (Kshatriya) caste. It appears that Khas kings recruited Kham men as guards and soldiers. Khas and Kham territories in the far west were subdivided into small kingdoms called the Baisi , literally '22' as they were counted.\nNepal has one of the world's highest birthrates because Hindu women usually marry by their early teens, causing their entire reproductive potential to be utilized. Furthermore, men who can afford it often take multiple wives. This may trace back to Khas culture, explaining relentless Khas colonization eastward as finite amounts of land suitable for rice cultivation were inevitably outstripped by high birthrates.\nThe Rapti river system east of the Karnali-Bheri had few lowlands suitable for growing rice and extensive highlands that were not attractive for Khas settlement but were a barrier to migration. However the Rapti's upper tributaries rose somewhat south of the Himalaya. Between these tributaries and the Dhaulagiri range of the Himalaya, a large east–west valley called Dhorpatan branching off the upper Bheri provided a detour eastward, over an easy pass called Jaljala into the Gandaki river system further east. The Gandaki is said to have seven major tributaries, most rising in or beyond the high Himalaya. They merge to cut through the Mahabharat and Siwalik ranges. In this basin elevations were generally lower and rainfall was higher compared to the Karnali-Bheri and Rapti basins. There was great potential for rice cultivation, the agricultural base of the Khas way of life.  A collection of small principalities called the Chaubisi developed. Chaubisi literally means '24', as these kingdoms were counted. Not all were Khas kindoms. Some were Magar, a large indigenous hill tribe people related to the Kham. Other kingdoms were Gurung and Tamang. Several Gandaki tributaries rose in the trans-Himalayan region where inhabitants and rulers became increasingly Tibetanized to the north.\nWithin the Chaubisi kingdoms of the Gandaki basin, Gorkha was a small valley east of Pokhara ruled by a Khas family now called Shah, an honorific title that may have come later, however any earlier name seems to be forgotten. In 1743 AD Prithvi Narayan Shah became the ruler of Gorkha after his father Nara Bhupal Shah died.  Prithvi Narayan already had a reputation as a hotheaded upstart. Resolving to modernize Gorkha's army, he was bringing modern arms from India when customs officers demanded inspection and payment of duties. Prithvi Narayan refused and attacked the officers, killing several before escaping with his arms and men. He also visited Benares to study the situation of local rulers and the growing encroachment of British interests. Prithvi concluded that invasion was a chronic danger to rulers on the plains of northern India, whereas the hills were more defensible and offered more scope to carve out a lasting empire.\nPrithvi Narayan must have been a charismatic figure, for he recruited, equipped and trained a formidable army and persuaded his subjects to underwrite all this from his ascension to the throne until his death in 1775. Through conquest and treaty, he consolidated several Chaubisi kingdoms. As his domain expanded, Khaskura became known as Gorkhali , i.e. the language of the Gorkha kingdom. Then he moved east into the next river basin, the Bagmati which drains the Kathmandu Valley that held three small but prosperous urban kingdoms. Like the Rapti, the Bagmati rises somewhat south of the Himalaya. Unlike the Rapti basin, this valley had once held a large lake and the remaining alluvial soil was exceptionally fertile. Between the agricultural abundance, local crafts, and extensive trade with Tibet, the cities were prosperous. Prithvi Narayan encircled the valley, cutting off trade and restricting ordinary activities, even farming and getting water. With a combination of stealth, brutality and intimidation he prevailed and deposed the local kings in 1769, making Kathmandu his new capital. This was the high point of Prithvi Narayan's career, however he continued consolidating the Kathmandu Valley with the Chaubisi and Baisi federations to the west until his death in 1775. Gorkhali was re-dubbed Nepali as 'Nepal' came to mean not only the urbanized Kathmandu Valley, but all lands ruled by the Shahs.\nPrithvi Narayan's heirs, Pratap Singh, Rana Bahadur and Girvan Yuddha continued expansion of their kingdom into the Koshi river basin east of the Bagmati system. Like the Gandaki, the Koshi traditionally has seven major tributaries descending from the Himalaya before joining forces to break through the Mahabharat and  Siwalik ranges. Ranges drained by Koshi tributaries include Mount Everest and its neighbouring peaks, as well as the western side of the Kangchenjunga massif. Kangchenjunga and a high ridge to the south are the watershed between the Koshi and Tista basins as well as the border between Nepal and the former kingdom Sikkim that India annexed in 1975.\nThe caste and ethnic groups of Nepal according to the 2001 census are classified into five main categories:\nAccording to one theory, Hindu castes migrated from India to Nepal after the 11th century due to Muslim invasion. Another theory says that present day Hindu hill castes come from the Buddhist/Hindu population of the ancient Khas kingdom (present day Mid-western and Far-western Nepal). The traditional Hindu caste system is based on the four Varna Vyavastha \"the class system\" of Brahmin (Bahun) priests, scholars and advisors; Kshatriya (Chhetri) rulers and warriors, Vaishya (merchants); Shudra (farmers and menial occupations not considered polluting). Below the Shudra Dalit perform 'polluting' work such as tanning and cleaning latrines. However, the middle Vaishya and Shudra are underrepresented in the hills, apparently because they did not have compelling reason to leave the plains while Muslim invaders tried to eliminate previous elites.  Dalits seem to have accompanied the upper castes into the hills because they were bound by longstanding patronage arrangements. However, the absence of Vaishya people in the Hindu hill population supports the second theory.\nTraditional caste rules govern who can eat with whom, especially when boiled rice is served, and who can accept water from whom. Until the 1950s these rules were enforced by law.\nDalits are subject to caste-based discrimination and so called ‘untouchability’ in social, economic, educational, political and religious areas. The National Dalit Commission (2002) categorized 28 cultural groups as Dalits. Some argue that the use of the term Dalit will never ever help to abolish caste-based untouchability. (Literally, 'Dalit' translates to 'suppressed' in Nepali.) There are suggestions that the term should not be used because it not only breeds inferiority but is also insulting.\nNewars, the indigenous people of the Kathmandu valley , follow both Hinduism and Buddhism. According to the 2001 census they can be classified into 40 distinct cultural groups, but all speak a common language called Nepal bhasa (Newa bhaaya). Newars use prevailing lingua francas to communicate outside their community: Nepali in the hills and Maithili, Bhojpuri and Awadhi in the Terai.\nThe ethnic groups of the hills, Tarai and mountain areas are grouped as Janajati. According to the National Foundation for Development of Indigenous Nationalities [ dead link ] (NFDIN), ethnic groups are those “who have their own mother tongue and traditional customs, a distinct cultural identity, a distinct social structure and written or oral history all of their own\". 61 Adibasi Janajatis have been recognised by the Nepal Government. Five are from the mountain regions, 20 from the Hills, 7 from inner Terai and 11 from the Terai region. A Janajati is a community who has its own mother tongue and traditional culture and yet does not fall under the conventional fourfold Varna of the Hindu system or the Hindu hierarchical caste structure according to the Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities [ dead link ] . Many of these ethnic groups are Hinduized to some degree, although Hindu practices supplement rather than replace more ancient beliefs and practices. Unlike the Hindus, many indigenous nationalities of Nepal such as the Sherpa people as well as the people of Muslim & Christian faiths, have a culture of eating beef.\nCaste and ethnic groups included in the ‘other’ category are Sikhs, Christians, Bengalis and Marawadis.\nDifferent indigenous nationalities are in different stages of development. Some indigenous nationalities are nomads, e.g. Raute, and some are forest dwellers, e.g. Chepang and Bankaria. Most of the indigenous nationalities rely on agriculture and pastoralism and very few are cosmopolitan, e.g. Newar.\nThe census of 2011 listed 10 religions: Hindu, Buddhist, Islam, Kirati (Kirati people worship nature and their ancestors, and practice shamanism), Christian, Jain, Sikh, Prakriti, Bon and Bahai. Of that total Hindus comprise 81% and Buddhists about 9%.\nNepal has a monsoonal climate with four main seasons - though traditionally a year was categorized into six distinct climate periods: Basanta (spring), Grishma (early summer), Barkha (summer monsoon), Sharad (early autumn), Hemanta (late autumn) and Shishir (winter).\nThe recording of temperatures and rainfall of the major locations across Nepal was started in 1962 and their averages provide a reference point for analysing the climate trend.\nCitizens of Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka may obtain a free visa-on-arrival for stays of up to 30 days regardless of reason of visit. Citizens of China (mainland), Hong Kong and Macau are also eligible for a free visa-on-arrival for stays of up to 30 days, but are only permitted to visit for tourism.\nNationals of Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Cameroon, Eswatini, Somalia, Liberia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan are required to obtain visas before arrival .\nTourist Visas are available on arrival for citizens of many countries at Kathmandu airport and designated frontier posts (see below) and cost:\nYou can also pay this on arrival in other convertible currencies such as euros, pounds sterling, Chinese reminbi and Australian dollars, although US dollars are always preferred and some smaller entry points (like Birgunj) may only accept US dollars, and Kodari only accepts US dollars and Chinese reminbi.\nAll tourist visas are the \"multiple entry\" type and allow multiple entries and exits during the period of validity.\nVisas can be applied for online at nepalimmigration.gov.np [ dead link ] , but as the online application form requires information about the intended place of stay in Nepal that is difficult to acquire (such as ward number, municipality, district etc.), it generally more convenient to complete the visa application after arrival.\nTo extend your tourist visa, visit the Nepal Immigration Office in Kathmandu or Pokhara with your passport and another photo, and pay US$2 for every day past your visa you want to stay, up to the maximum of 150 days per year.\nCash payment is recommended (non-USDs are also accepted, but expect the exchange rate not to be the best). Visa and Mastercard payments are also available—they are coded as cash advances on the credit card. A US$1 fee is added in addition to the required visa payment amount if paying with credit card.\nCheck up to date border crossings at official website of Nepali immigration: https://www.immigration.gov.np/en/offices\nKathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport ( KTM IATA ) is the only international airport in Nepal. Although Nepal is a popular tourist destination, most flights from anywhere will stop on the way in other parts of Asia, such as the Middle East. Because of this, expect long travel times if you're coming from Europe or North America.\nWith the more stable political situation, more airlines are offering flights to Nepal. Some are listed in the Kathmandu city article .\nMany travellers ride from India on motorcycles; however, four-wheelers have increased in the mid-2020s. Foreigners have to pay customs at the borders but most don't bother. Crossing the border requires you to pay a daily toll of Rs120 and a transport permit of Rs50 (one time), the police can ask you for these two documents any time during your ride. Selling the bike in Nepal is easy as other travellers are looking for bikes to ride back to India. If you're coming from India you'll find driving in Nepal a lot less chaotic. The roads are amazing and the new east–west highway under construction with support from the Japanese will open up new destinations for those interested in exploring Nepal by motor-bike.\nPlease check before hiring a motorbike on the current state of fuel. In late 2009 there were problems with fuel supply which can leave riders stranded. Bike hire should cost around Rs500 a day (Pulsar, Hero Honda, scooter) unless you are hiring an Royal Enfield.\nRental companies are also notorious for trying to charge tourists large amounts of money for 'damage' that may not have done by you on returning the bike. Therefore, make sure a thorough damage assessment is carried out before departing and, if the hirer tries to scam you on return, go to the local police.\nThe best route to explore Nepal by road on motorcycle, is to enter from the border crossing of Banbasa- Mahendra Nagar, just after the border crossing, the Mahendra Highway (made with collaboration from India) is amazing to ride on.\nThere are several border crossings to China, but they all face Tibet and are thus not open to independent travel: you will need to arrange a permit and join an organized tour. See that article for details.\nCargo and passenger trains operate between Sirsiya in southern Nepal, and the Indian town of Raxaul. However, except for Indians, foreigners are not allowed to cross the border with it. The internal train network is limited to a few kilometres of train network in Janakpur .\nThere are a number of domestic airlines in Nepal such as Yeti Air, Tara Air and Nepal Airlines that offer frequent flights to many destinations around the country. Destinations to and from Kathmandu include places like Biratnagar, Nepalganj , Lukla, Pokhara , Simikot, Jomsom, Janakpur and Bharatpur . To arrange flights from outside Nepal, there are a number of on-line booking agents who can make bookings, take payment (credit/debit cards/PayPal) and then send e-tickets. If you are buying tickets while in Nepal or if you are flying at short notice, it is necessary to be flexible on flight times and dates as the planes often get fully booked in advance. Cancellations and delays due to severe weather conditions do occur. If you have time, just board the next plane.\nNepal has left-hand traffic. There is little awareness of pedestrians' rights. Roads are often narrow and in poor condition. Rains and landslides affect the condition of the already poor road network, increasing the risk of road accidents. Avoid using local buses, especially those that are overloaded and in poor condition. Travelling after dark increases the risk of serious road accidents.\nAn international driving licence is required to drive a car. This card must be carried when driving, as well as all documents relating to the car. Traffic accidents involving a foreigner are almost invariably considered to be caused by a foreigner. Claims for damages in such accidents are often high.\nFuel shortages can sometimes occur, which may throw your driving-related plans into chaos.\nCustom or classic motorbikes in form 350 cc and 500 cc Royal Enfield bikes are available for rent including lessons, repairs and tours. Furthermore, local motorbikes are another choice and can be rented in the Thamel area of Kathmandu.\nNepalese law requires the driver to wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle or scooter.\nWith the petrol crisis, motorcycle rental has become a costly choice, depending on availability; 1 litre of petrol costs Rs160–165 on top of the rental fee (Rs800–3000). Mopeds are cheaper while motorbikes are more costly.\nRental companies are also notorious for trying to charge tourists large amounts of money for 'damage' that may not have done by you on returning the bike. Therefore, make sure a thorough damage assessment is carried out before departing and, if the hirer tries to scam you on return, go to the local police.\nWhen renting a motorbike or scooter, it should be remembered that vehicles are rarely insured. The hirer is liable for any damage caused to the vehicle. It is not advisable to leave your passport as a deposit when renting a vehicle.\nYou can also rent a bicycle to travel around Kathmandu at a very reasonable price (Rs500–5,000) according to the condition or quality of bicycle and the rental period.\nAlthough motor roads are penetrating further into the hinterlands, many destinations can only be reached on foot (or by helicopter). Some require a permit. See Trekking below.\nFor reliable maps, GPS navigation , comprehensive trails and map information, consult OpenStreetMap , which is also used by this travel guide and by many mobile Apps like OsmAnd or Mapy.cz . Or just download the according GPX or KML files for trails on OpenStreetMap through Waymarked Trails . (Note, you just need to change the OpenStreetMap relation ID of the trail to download its GPX or KML files through the same link.) Of course, to get around by yourselves outside of cities, you also need sufficient skills, and you should ascertain that you have appropriate backups for your navigation solutions.\nThe great biological and cultural diversity of present-day Nepal is matched by its linguistic diversity. Nepal boasts a variety of living languages many of which are remnants of the traditional Asiatic cultural amalgamation in the region, it has an impressively large number for a country with such a small land mass. Nepal has more distinct and individual languages in one country than the whole of the European community.\nThe official language of Nepal is Nepali . It's related to Hindi, Punjabi, and other Indo-Aryan languages, and is normally written with the Devanagari script (as is Hindi), originated from Sanskrit. While most Nepalis speak at least some Nepali, a large percentage of the population has as their mother tongue another language, such as Tharu around Chitwan, Newari in the Kathmandu Valley, and Sherpa in the Everest area.\nAlthough Nepal was never a British colony, English is somewhat widespread among educated Nepalis. Nevertheless, learning even a few words of Nepali is fun and useful, especially outside of the tourist district and while trekking (porters often speak very little English and the inquisitive children in the tea houses are delighted to hear a few words of Nepali from their house guests). As Asian languages go, Nepali has to be one of the easiest to learn, and the traveller making the effort isn't likely to make worse blunders than many natives with a different first language. The locals are also happy to help with your burgeoning language skills.\nA disturbingly large number of Nepal's mother tongues are severely endangered and will likely cease to be living languages within a generation.\nVarious UNESCO sites have sustained severe (and in some cases irreparable) damage from the 2015 earthquake. Do not expect all listed sites to be open to visitors.\nBeginning in March 2023, travelers who trek in remote regions must hire a government-licensed guide or join a group . This rule was implemented because of the cost of search-and-rescue operations for trekkers who get lost.\n101,320 trekkers visited Nepal in 2007.  Of that number, 60,237 (59.4%) visited Annapurna area while those visiting the Everest and Langtang regions accounted for 26,511 (26.5%) and 8,165 (8.1%) respectively.\n\"Tea-house trekking\" is the easiest way to trek as it doesn't require support. Tea houses have developed into somewhat rustic full-scale tourist lodges with showers, pizza, pasta and beer. The day's hikes are between lodge-filled settlements or villages: there's no need to take tents, food, water or beer. All those things, plus luxuries such as apple pie, can be purchased along the way. Physical requirements range from easy to strenuous.\nFacilities available in remote areas are less extensive than in the more popular areas thus these areas are often visited in organised groups, with guide, porters and full support. Manaslu , Kanchenjunga , Dolpo , Mustang and Humla require Restricted Area Permits , requiring a minimum of two foreign trekkers plus a registered/qualified guide. Progress is being made however, and tea-houses are becoming more available in all of these areas. Before setting out on any trek, make sure you find out what the current facilities are in that area, as they are changing every year.\nEverest lies in the region known as Khumbu - To get here, take a bus to Jiri or fly to Lukla then hike up to Namche Bazzar , capital of the Sherpa lands at the foot of Everest. Main \"teahouse trek\" regions, in each of these areas there are a number of trail options, there is plenty of scope for short treks of less than a week to much longer if you have time and wanderlust.\nTrekking peaks require a qualified \"climbing guide\", permits and deposits to cover camp waste disposal:\nTourism is a dynamic sector of economy and accepting it as a vehicle of poverty reduction is a relatively new concept in Nepal. Nepal is a predominantly rural society, with 85% of the population living in the countryside. Naturally, Nepal's rich culture and ethnic diversity are best experienced in its village communities. You can engage in local activities, learn how to cook local cuisine or take part in agricultural activities like kitchen gardening, etc.\nIn the rural Nepal context, pro-poor tourism means expanding employment and small enterprise opportunities especially pro-indigenous peoples, youth and pro-women. Pro-poor initiatives in Nepal include the UNDP-TRPAP [ dead link ] and ILO-EMPLED projects.\nTrekking on the Indigenous Peoples Trail and the Numbur Cheese Circuit is a means for Nepali as well as foreign visitors to experience the rural and traditional Nepali way of life, and for the local community to participate in and benefit directly from tourism. You'll feel better knowing that your visit is genuinely helping your hosts. And if you want to simply lie on a beach, well, the Majhi Fishing Experience on the Sun Kosi in Ramechhap features one of the best beaches in Nepal.\nEthno-tourism is increasingly popular in Nepal and is designed to maximize social and economic benefits to the local communities and minimize negative impacts to cultural heritage and the environment. Ethno-tourism is a specialized type of cultural tourism and can be defined as any excursion which focuses on the works of humans rather than nature, and attempts to give the tourist an understanding of the lifestyles of local people.\nOther more remote regions will require a bit more planning and probably local assistance, not least as the required permits are only issued via Nepali guides/agents. Camping is required on one or more nights.\nNepal is one of the poorest countries in the world and hiring a local company will benefit the local economy, however the involvement of travel agents in Kathmandu must be approached with caution. The numbers of travel, trekking and rafting agencies registered in 2007 were 1,078, 872 and 94 respectively. The rapid growth in tourism in Nepal coupled with the absence of a self-regulating code of conduct has helped to grow unhealthy competition among travel agents with regular undercutting in tariffs. Such undesirable actions take away benefits not only from trekking guides and porters but also from others engaged in supplying goods and providing services to the tourists. By paying lower tariffs tourists may save money but directly at the expense of local communities. Try to use 'socially responsible' tour operators that promote proper porter treatment and cultural and environmental sensitivity among their clients in line with the UN-WTO Sustainable Tourism Criteria [ dead link ] .\nWhile organized groups from \" western tour operators \" from overseas drain the operational profit out of the country, organized groups hire a larger amount of local workforce from porters to guides.\nWith local tour operators, most of the operational profit remains in the country. Groups are more likely to go remote areas, and rely as much as possible on local resources to minimize transport cost and hire maximum local porters.\nIn comparison, individual travellers are concentrated on the main trails with lodges and usually a lower budget. These trekkers usually use simpler lodges with lower costs. They may venture less often into remote areas, as that would mean more expense or very basic local services which most try to avoid. They generally spend less than organized travellers on same trails simply because they often have more restricted budgets.\nSafety and comfort are higher with organized tours. There is a full range of choice for any demand, just be sure to think about what trekking means for you. For the hard core trekkers, no porter will ever carry, while for others, to carry a 15-18 kg backpack might be more than they would want.\nRafting trips of 1 to 10 days on many rivers and for all levels of experience leave from Kathmandu and Pokhara . For detailed itineraries visit the Nepal Association of Rafting Agents [ dead link ] . The main rivers for rafting are:\nMany companies offer Learn to Kayak Clinics on the Trishuli river, an ideal spot to take your first steps into the world of whitewater.\nMountain biking in Nepal is fun and at times challenging event. There are many popular biking routes:\nThe best time to go for biking is between mid October and late March, when the atmosphere is clear the climate is temperate: warm during the days and cool during the night. Biking in other times of the year is also possible but great care should be taken while biking during the monsoon season (June to September) as the roads are slippery. Biking can be done independently or can be organized through biking companies of Nepal.\nYou can rent mountain bikes of almost any quality, but remember that if you're going on a longer or harder ride, at least your own saddle would be a good option to bring. In late 2009 the daily rental costs ranged from US$3 for a simple bike to US$30 for a western bikes with suspension.\nNepal's geography and climate makes for some of the best motorcycling roads in the world. The traffic is a little chaotic, but not aggressive, and the speeds are low. Be aware that you need an international driving licence in Nepal, even though you might never be stopped by the police as a tourist on a bike.\nPerhaps the best and most original way to explore the country is by motorcycle. Kathmandu should be avoided by beginners, but the rest of Nepal is simply amazing. Hearts and Tears Motorcycle Club, Wild Experience Tours & Blazing Trails Tours are the better known names in the industry. They specialize in motorcycle touring and have a great collection of custom bikes. They are professional set-ups with imported safety equipment, structured training and well organized group tours.\nSince 2007 that the Nepal Canyoning Association was founded, a lot of canyons (khola in Nepali) have been equipped for organized descents. The 2011 IRC (International Canyoning Rendezvous) took place in the Marshyangdi River valley in the Annapurna region. There are at least 30 canyons where private companies organize excursions for descents. The Nepali canyons offer breathtaking views of the valleys and rice fields below and various combinations of difficulty and water level. Most canyons can only be accessed on foot from the nearby roads, through paths used by the locals for agriculture purposes or accessing their homes. In 2011, one of the longest and most difficult canyons in the world was equipped in an expedition by the \"Himalayan Canyon Team\" in the Chamje Khola.\nChitwan National Park offers elephant rides, jungle canoeing, nature walks and bird watching, as well as more adventurous tiger and rhino-viewing. There are also many other less visited parks including Bardiya and Shuklaphanta National Park .\n\"The Last Resort\", near the Tibetan border, has frequent Full Moon trance parties, lasting 2-3 days. Watch for posters and check music shops. Pokhara has started featuring its own brand of Full Moon raves and interesting Western takes on Nepali festivals.\nExchange rates fluctuate. Current rates for these and other currencies are available from XE.com\nNepalese rupees are the local currency, denoted by the symbol \" रु \" or \" Rs \" (ISO currency code: NPR ).\nCoins of Nepal come in denominations of 1 and 2 rupees. Banknotes of Nepal come in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000 rupees.\nAlthough Indian currency is also widely accepted in Nepal (at an official exchange rate of 1.60 Nepalese rupees to 1 Indian rupee), it is officially illegal to carry or trade in any Indian rupee note above 100 rupees (being the 200, 500 and 1,000 Indian rupee notes). In practice though these higher value notes are still unofficially accepted, even at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport to pay for your government issued visa on arrival.\nThere are banks in Kathmandu , Pokhara , Chitwan , Nepalgunj , Janakpur , Lumbini and in several other major cities that will allow you to retrieve cash from ATM or credit cards. There are many ATMs in those cities that are open around the clock.\nKeep all currency exchange and ATM receipts as they are required at the airport bank to convert back to your original currency. If you don't have them, they will refuse to convert your currency but they will suggest going to the Duty Free shop upstairs, even though it isn't a licensed money changer. Traveller's cheques may be useful outside of the major cities.\nAll ATMs in Nepal charge a withdrawal fee of at least रु500 . The ATMs likely to have the lowest fee depends on how much you're withdrawing (listed in order from most to fewest branches):\nNote that the fee charged can vary depending on your card type, where your bank is and sometimes even the specific ATM you're using. Check fees when using an ATM you haven't used before, or the same ATM with a different card. If one of these ATMs is not nearby then check this table to help find a favourable alternative:\nThe Nepali national meal is daal-bhaat-tarkaari . It is spiced lentils poured over boiled rice, and served with tarkari: vegetables cooked with spices. This is served in most Nepalese homes and teahouses, two meals a day at about 10:00 and 19:00 or 20:00  If rice is scarce the grain part may be cornmeal mush called aata, barley, or sukkha roti (whole wheat 'tortillas'). The meal may be accompanied by dahi (yogurt) and a small helping of ultra-spicy fresh chutney or achaar (pickle). Traditionally this meal is eaten with the right hand. Curried meat, goat or chicken, is an occasional luxury, and freshwater fish is often available near lakes and rivers. Because Hindus hold cattle to be sacred, beef is not part of traditional Nepali cuisine, but can still be obtained for a high price in some expensive restaurants. Buffalo and yak are eaten by some but considered too cow-like by others. Pork is eaten by some tribes, but not by upper-caste Hindus. As in India, there are some communities and tribes that are vegetarian.\nOutside the main morning and evening meals, a variety of snacks may be available. Tea, made with milk and sugar is certainly a pick-me-up.  Corn may be heated and partially popped, although it really isn't popcorn. This is called \"kha-jaa\", meaning \"eat and run\". Rice may be heated and crushed into \"chiura\" resembling uncooked oatmeal that can be eaten with yogurt, hot milk and sugar, or other flavourings. Fritters called 'pakora' and turnovers called \"samosa\" can sometimes be found, as can sweets made from sugar, milk, fried batter, sugar cane juice, etc. Be sure such delicacies are either freshly cooked or have been protected from flies. Otherwise flies land in the human waste that is everywhere in the streets, then on your food, and so you become a walking medical textbook of gastrological conditions.\nBecause of the multi-ethnic nature of Nepali society, differing degrees of adherence to Hindu dietary norms, and the extreme range of climates and micro-climates throughout the country, different ethnic communities often have their own specialties.\nNewars, an ethnic group originally living in the Kathmandu Valley, are connoisseurs of great foods who lament that feasting is their downfall, whereas sexual indulgence is said to be the downfall of Pahari Chhetri. In the fertile Kathmandu and Pokhara valleys this cuisine often includes a greater variety of foodstuffs, particularly vegetables, than what are available in most of the hills. As such, Newari cuisine is quite distinct and diverse relatively compared to the other indigenous regional cuisines of Nepal, so watch out for Newari restaurants. Some of them even come with cultural shows: a good way to enjoy good food while having a crash-course in Nepalese culture.\nThe cuisine of the Terai lowlands is almost the same as in adjacent parts of India. Locally-grown tropical fruits are sold alongside subtropical and temperate temperate crops from the hills. In addition to bananas ('kera') and papayas ('mewa') familiar to travellers, jackfruit ('katar') is a local delicacy.\nSome dishes, particularly in the Himalayan region, are Tibetan in origin and not at all spicy. Some dishes to look for include momos , a meat or vegetable filled dumpling, which is similar to Chinese pot-stickers. Momos has become very popular in past few decades. Momos can be found almost everywhere in Kathmandu and other towns in Nepal, whether it be a big hotel or a small restaurant. Other dishes like Tibetan Bread and Honey a puffy fried bread with heavy raw honey that's great for breakfast. Up in the Himalayan mountains, potatoes are the staple of the Sherpa people. Try the local dish of potato pancakes ( rikikul ). They are delicious eaten straight off the griddle and covered with dzo (female yak) butter or cheese.\nPizza, Mexican, Thai and Chinese food and Middle-Eastern food can all be found in the tourist districts of Kathmandu , Pokhara and Chitwan . If you are on a budget, eating local dishes will save money.\nMany small restaurants are not prepared to cook several different dishes; try to stick with one or two dishes or you will find yourself waiting as the cook tries to make one after another on a one-burner stove in those small restaurants.\nAs far as possible, eat only Nepali village products. If you take only village product foods, it will help them economically.\nAlthough not as internationally famous as Indian brands, Nepal does in fact have a large organic tea industry. Most plantations are in the east of the country and the type of tea grown is very similar to that produced in neighbouring Darjeeling . Well known varieties are Dhankuta, Illam, Jhapa, Terathhum and Panchthar (all named after their growing regions). Over 70% of Nepal's tea is exported and the tea you see for sale in Thamel, while they serve as token mementos, are merely the scrapings from the bottom of the barrel.\nBudget accommodation in Nepal ranges from around Rs250 to around Rs750 for a double. The prices you are told at first are not fixed so you should haggle. Especially if you want to stay for a longer period, you can get a large discount. Cheaper rooms usually do not have sheets, blankets, towels, or anything else besides a bed and a door. Most budget hotels and guesthouses have a wide range of rooms, so be sure to see what you are getting, even if you have stayed there before. Usual price for three-star equivalent hotel (AC, bathroom, Internet access and satellite TV in the room) is around Rs1,500 for a double, a bit more in Kathmandu. Accommodations might easily be the cheapest part of your budget in Nepal.\nHowever, if you prefer luxurious accommodation, the best hotels equal approximately to four star hotels in western countries (unlimited access to swimming pool or whirlpool, no power outages, room service, very good restaurant and buffet breakfasts). Expect the price being much higher (circa US$50 for a double or US$100 for an apartment, even more in Kathmandu). In these hotels, all prices are usually fixed. In Kathmandu, some luxurious hotels require going through security check when entering.\nVisitors to Nepal should be aware that it is illegal to do volunteering \"work\" on a tourist Visa. In order to volunteer legally, the organization who will engage you must obtain for you a non-tourist visa.\nUnfortunately, volunteer tourism has mostly become more profitable than real tourism. Foreign operators and Nepali agents have found an inexhaustible supply of well-meaning but naive people who will pay sometimes even big amounts to \"volunteer\" in Thamel, Lakeside and Chitwan. See Volunteer travel#Be wary .\nTeaching English is a popular project for volunteers and is often combined with courses in computer literacy or health and physical education. The Nepali school system, which many children only attend for a few years, requires English fluency so there is always a demand for native English speakers of all ages, races and nationalities. There have been few prerequisites for teaching beyond fluency in English. Be aware that many schools, especially private ones, charge families higher fees if \"foreign teachers present\" and often locally available English teachers may not be able to find work because of the number of foreign mostly illegally engaged foreign volunteers, many of whom may be illegally employed.\nIf you want to teach, a school may request and obtain a non tourist visa for you so you can teach legally.\nThere are many options for finding volunteer opportunities. Several international volunteer organizations, will find you a project, room and boarding, either at the school or with a local family for a fee. This \"fee\" can range from US$500-2000 depending on the type and length of program. Often only little of that money will go to the school and host family, often they are too poor even to support a volunteer, so the bulk often goes to the agency.\nSome organisations will provide language and culture lessons as well as general teaching supplies and support. Once you make a deposit on a particular program there may be limited options for change. Programs can last from two weeks to five months if made in tourist visa, but keep in mind a regular, legal work and a longer stay may be more rewarding for both you and the school, as it can take several weeks to get into the swing of things. Above all, examine carefully how your money is spent and who really benefits.\nAn alternative to paid placement is to find a local, grassroots program, or to contact schools directly in Kathmandu when you arrive. Local hostels and restaurants usually have bulletin boards full of often doubtful requests for volunteers. More and more local groups are placing ads on the web as well. These programs are more likely to charge only for room and board, but you will need to do some research to find out the specifics of each group and what, if any, support you will receive. Waiting until you arrive also lets you get to know the areas you can volunteer in and allows you to shop around for a situation that best suits you. These placements tend to be longer term (3-5 months), but this is always negotiable with a specific school or project.\nAlways check if your engagement does not take away work of other people and that your volunteer work is done legally and that the community profits from the deal. Report to police or other serious NGO/INGO any kind of misuse. Always demand written receipts with complete organisation address, stamp and signatures. This helps to prevent siphoning off precious development funds, which generally tend to not reach the intended beneficiaries most of time. Estimates go from 85-95% for funds spent on \"logistics\", \"office expenses\", \"allowances\", vehicles and so forth.\nAll foreigners who hold valid visas through 8 September 2025 can obtain free exit permits and visa regularization at any immigration offices or at points of departure.\nStay away from any protests, stay tuned to the latest news, and pay attention to any evacuation information by your country.\nSometimes, there are strikes (\"bandas\") and demonstrations to contend with.  Some businesses close, but many allowances are usually made for tourists, who are widely respected. Ask about strikes at your hotel or read the English language Nepali newspapers.\nThe Maoist insurgency ended in 2006 after they signed comprehensive peace agreement with the government, in which they agreed to become a mainstream political party and participate in elections. The government is in the hand of Nepali Congress as it wins the election of 2014. Due to the change in government the tourists are now much more safer than before. The trekking routes and other tourist destinations are safe for travel. If your country has an embassy or consulate in Nepal, let them know your whereabouts & plans, and at least listen seriously to any cautionary advice they offer.\nIt is not unheard of for Maoist \"tax collectors\" to collect \"revolutionary taxes\" from trekkers. They may approach you as a large group. Even though this is effectively extortion, it is not always an unfriendly encounter and should not assume the worst. They will usually provide a receipt for the tax and claim that it will provide you with security and safe passage within the area that you are in. It is best to defer to your guide and if your guide suggests that you pay the tax, accept the recommendation. You can negotiate and haggle, or refuse outright, and they will either press harder, threaten you or leave you alone entirely. This has become progressively rarer since the Maoist insurgency ended in 2006 (especially on the trek to the Everest basecamp) but is still imposed in some areas.\nEarthquakes are common across Nepal. The lack of emergency equipment and poorly resourced medical facilities is likely to worsen an earthquake’s impact. British Embassy assistance will be slow to reach you if you are in a remote area.\nA very bad and most famous example of an earthquake which hit Nepal was the 2015 Nepal Earthquake, which caused severe damage and killed many people\nThe National Society of Earthquake Technology (NSET) gives advice on what to do in an earthquake, check with your tour operator to find out what contingency plans they have for an earthquake.\nFollowing a significant earthquake you should expect transport, accommodation and basic services in affected areas to be disrupted. Relief efforts are likely to be a priority for the authorities. Check with your tour company or hotel for further information on whether travel to an area is possible or appropriate.\nNepal's cities are safer than most, and even pickpockets are rare. It's relatively safe for women and solo travellers as compared to many other South Asian countries. Nevertheless, don't flash cash or make ostentatious displays of wealth. It is advised to take trekking guide when trekking to a Himalayan region.\nBe cautious with the public transport. Roads are narrow, steep, winding & frequently crowded. Domestic flights with a private company are safer than the roads. Flying risks are greatest before & during the monsoon season when the mountains are usually clouded over.\nIf you should be seriously injured or sick where there are no roads or airports available, medical evacuation by helicopter may be your last best chance. If there is no firm guarantee that the bill will be paid, companies offering these services may demur, so look into insurance covering medical evacuations. You might ask if your embassy or consulate guarantees payment.\nGreet people with a warm Namaste (or \"Namaskar\" formal version - to an older or high-status person) with palms together, fingers up. It is used in place of hello or goodbye. Don't say it more than once per person, per day. The least watered down definition of the word:  'The divine in me salutes the divine in you.'\nFeet are considered dirty. Don't point the bottoms of your feet at people or religious icons. Do not step over a person who may be seated or lying on the ground. Be sensitive to when it is proper to remove your hat or shoes. It is proper to take off your shoes before entering a residential house.\nThe left hand is considered unclean because it is used to wash after defecating. Many Nepali hotel & guest house toilets have bidet attachments, like a kitchen sink sprayer, for this purpose in lieu of toilet paper. It is considered insulting to touch anyone with the left hand. It is proper to poke someone, take and give something with the right hand.\nCircumambulate Buddhist shrines and temples, chortens, stupas, mani walls, monasteries etc. in a clockwise direction. Hindu shrines and temples have no such practice.\nWhen haggling over prices, smile, laugh and be friendly. Be prepared to allow a reasonable profit. Don't be a miser or insult fine craftsmanship, it's much better to lament that you are too poor to afford such princely quality.\nMany Hindu temples do not allow non-Hindus inside certain parts of the temple complex. Be aware & respectful of this fact, as these are places of worship, not tourist attractions.\nBeing a non-Hindu makes you moderately impure to some strict Hindus. Avoid touching containers of water; let someone pour it into your drinking container. Likewise avoid touching food that others will be eating. Make sure you are invited before entering someone's house. You may only be welcome on the outer porch, or in the yard. Shoes are routinely left on the front porch or in a specific area near the front door.\nWash hands before and after eating.  Touch food only with the right hand if you're not left-handed.\nInternet connectivity is increasing rapidly, and obviously its availability is most widespread in Kathmandu (especially in Thamel and around the Boudha Stupa in Boudhanath) or Pokhara . In those two cities, most hotels and lodges will have free Internet connection with Wi-Fi. So will many restaurants. More and more villages will have Internet available at some lodges, usually with Wi-Fi.  For example, in 2013, Wi-Fi was available in lodges in Jomsom and Muktinath.  In the more remote villages, however, there may only be the occasional Internet cafe that is available. For example, Chame (on the Annapurna circuit) has an Internet cafe with secured Wi-Fi for Rs15 per minute. Even more remote villages may have Internet via satellite connection, but it is quite pricey at over Rs100 per minute.\nMail can be received at many guesthouses or at Everest Postal Care, opposite Fire & Ice on Tridevi Marg. Phone calls are best made from any of the international phone offices in Kathmandu . Voice over Internet (VOI) is usually Rs1-2/min. Mobile phones are the best option (see below).\nThere are two main mobile operators in Nepal: government-run NTC (Nepal Telecom Company) and private Ncell (previously called Spice Mobile and Mero Mobile).\nBoth operators allow tourists to buy SIM cards for about Rs200 in Kathmandu and most major towns. You will need to bring a passport photo, fill in a form and have your passport and visa page photocopied.\nNcell SIMs can be bought from many stores, but are best bought from official stores in Birgunj or Kathmandu. Micro SIMs can be cut for free if you need.\nNTC SIMs can be bought from their official offices and mobile stores across the country. They do not publish their coverage maps. However they do have superior remote coverage to Ncell, particularly on the Annapurna, Everest and other trekking routes.\nThe most common plug types to be found on devices are C (Europlug), F (\"Schuko\"), G (UK), D and M.\nSockets mostly accept multiple types of plugs. Most modern wall sockets will accept types A, B, C, E, F, G, I and D. Some will additionally support type M. Note that the European plugs (types C, E and F) will typically sit rather loosely in these \"universal sockets\", so it can be advisable to use an adapter.\nOccasionally you may also see older sockets which only support types D and M. However, at least one \"modern\" socket will usually be present in a room.\nAdapters can be purchased inexpensively in Kathmandu for around ₨100, and some have fuses built in. Try shopping in Thamel or the Kumari Arcade in Kathmandu.\nElectricity on treks can be scarce. In remote parts there may only be solar powered electricity. Expect to pay Rs100-200 per hour to charge devices on many tea-house treks, including the Everest base camp trek.\nIf you have devices that will need regular recharging, you may wish to purchase in advance a small solar panel and battery pack."

    "content": "As soon as you land and come out of the Tribhuvan International Airport, you will be welcomed and picked by our staff. You will be transferred to your hotel. It is at the hotel, our tour leader will come to meet you and will brief you about the trip. The tour leader will provide you brief information about the itinerary, and importantly will introduce you to your trekking leader. We request you to provide the tour leader a copy of your passport, 2 passport size photos, travel insurance etc.\nThis trek is suitable for any person who is physically fit. It’s not a problem even if you don’t have any previous experiences of trekking. You can make this route as a starting point of adventure in your life. But please be sure that you take some physical fitness exercises such as running, swimming, hiking, etc. before you decide to embark on your journey this route. Please also note that it is natural that sometimes you may feel discomfort before you acclimatized yourself. This means you need to begin some kind of training at least two to three months before you make departure for this trekking. It is recommended that you take an hour of aerobic exercise 3 to 4 times per week in order to enjoy the height and the climate of this route in order to make your experience wonderful and memorable.\nThere two best seasons for trekking in the Nepali mountains. The first season starts in the second week of February. March, April, May, and the first week June bring thousands of trekkers all over the world to the Nepali mountains. Again the second-best season for trekking in the Nepali mountains starts from the second week of September. October, November, and the first of December bring another round of thousands of trekkers to the Nepali mountains.\nThe period between the First Week of February and the First Week of June is often regarded as the best season for trekking in the Nepali mountains. Temperatures during this period in the Nepali mountains remain relatively warm 10° to 15°, much warmer than the one you experience during the winter. The most important thing about this season is that mornings mostly remain bright and clear. The afternoons remain mostly filled with warm air. The rhododendron forests in springtime create a spectacular scenes. You can experience the wild and natural “Himalayan” beauty. Needless to say, June is much warmer and greener.\nAnother best season for trekking in the Nepali mountains is from September to the half of December. This is often regarded as the ideal time for the panoramic view of mountains. Days during these months typically remain sunny and clear. Moderate temperatures and comparatively cool evenings make the experience of trekking in this part of the world quite unique.\nPlease be informed that July to August is the season of monsoon in Nepal. But the monsoon is mountains are different from the ones in the plains. Making trekking around Mustang, Rara, Dolpo, Annapurna circuit, Lantang Valley, Jomsom Trek, Everest base camp, and Gokyo valley during this season enables you to explore nature in their unique blend.\nWhile you stay in Kathmandu, we offer you accommodation in a hotel of two to three stars as part of our BB plan. Similarly, while you are in your trekking you offer you accommodation in the teahouse (mountain lodge) as part of our AP plan (accommodation, breakfast, lunch, and dinner). We would like to inform you that teahouses (mountain lodge) are more like hotels. They offer hot showers, western food, and private rooms (twin sharing). As part of this plan, you will be served overnight halts with dinner and breakfast win teahouses (lodges), and lunches in local restaurants en-route. With it, you will be able to experience truly Nepali cultures and lifestyles.\nWell, there is nothing to worry about it. You can buy mineral water, boiled water, or filter water during the trekking. But you suggest you to bring iodine tablets with you.\nDuring the days of trekking, you will be woken up at 7 am early morning. After a quick breakfast, we repack our duffel bag and leave the place with our Sherpas.\nYou will find yourself on the trail by 8 a.m. We love to see you trek at your own pace. We suggest you carry a daypack and camera. Our Sherpa guides are known worldwide for taking their guest through spectacular scenes created by the flora and fauna of the mountain world of Nepal. They know the best place to stop for a while and relax, purchase some snacks or soda, use toilet facilities, and buy souvenirs.\nThe best time for lunch for you would be the hour between 11:30 and 12:30 in the afternoon. Your hike usually ends in between 3:30 pm to 4 pm every day. After your dinner is served, its time you spent playing cards, music or reflecting on all wondrous moments and planning about the plan for the following day.\nMost of the trekking routes you follow provide you modern communication facilities. Telephones and Internet services are available in almost all trekking areas in Nepal. Needless to say, electricity facilities too are available at almost all trekking areas. Please remember to bring TWO and THREE pin travel adapters with you. In case you forget, just ask our guide they will take you to the supermarkets or electronic shops in Kathmandu.\nNepali Currency is spelled as Nepali Rupee (Rs). Currently, in Nepal notes of the following denominations are used: 1000, 500, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2, and 1 rupee. Nepal has modern banking facilities. Almost all foreign currencies along with credit cards such as American Express, Visa, and Master card are accepted in Nepal. Most of the towns you happen to pass through during your trekking provide you ATM facilities too.\nPlease be informed that travel insurance is compulsory for all Clients undertaking trekking of all kinds in Nepal. The insurance should provide you adequate protection during the tour completely. It should cover personal injury, medical expenses, repatriation expenses, helicopter evacuation, loss of luggage, etc.\nOur guides can provide their services 24 hours a day during the trek. They hold basic training in first aid, and hold knowledge about providing medicines of basic levels should you feel any kind of uneasy in your body. They also know how to take or us Ox meter to track your oxygen levels. They know if you are fit enough to continue trekking. Local health posts are also available in the route. The foreign doctors have established many such health posts, and overseas personnel mainly in the Everest and Annapurna route staff many. You can have thorough checking-in such health posts.\nIn case, trekkers become seriously sick and they need helicopter rescue urgently, the helicopter company will require a payment guarantee before they transport the trekkers to the hospital. In such a situation, we call or send emails to the insurance company of our trekkers. Only after receiving the guarantee of payment, we will be able to send a helicopter to save your life then admin at the reputed hospital.\nPlease be sure that the clothes you carry with you should be light enough for the warmth of the days and importantly warm enough for the cold nights of the Himalayas.\nNepal has various climates. Clothes of light and warm materials are a must. We suggest you carry a dress of casual and comfortable styles. As you climb altitudes above 2000m, you must wear warm woolen clothes but as you start trailing down to lower altitude cotton clothes can make you feel a lot more comfortable. Therefore, you are suggested to bring comfortable clothes suitable for both humid and chilly conditions.\nIn case, you don’t possess the four-season sleeping bag/ jackets and duffel bag, please don’t worry about it. We do provide such necessity in free of cost for the duration of trekking.\nHotels you stay in Kathmandu or our office can provide storage services without any cost. You are suggested to leave your belongings that are needed during the trekking at the hotel or at our office.\nTrekkers in Nepal have to use Twin Otter and Dornier’s primary modes of transport to and from the airstrip. Since you are trekking in the geographically as well as climate-wise the most difficult part of the world, it is natural that flights get canceled. Mountain weather conditions or technical issues are something we cannot predict. In case of cancellation of flights, we can hire a helicopter for you to maintain your schedule.\nA helicopter facility can only be provided if our clients agree to pay the extra charges. Needless to say, the helicopter takes 4 to 6 passengers at a time and the cost can be shared amongst the passengers.\nWe would like to repeat it that in case the helicopter service is required, the trekkers must pay the cost. We can help you prepare documents you need to submit to the travel insurance company for reimbursement.\nPlease be informed that the Twin Otter and Dornier aircraft allow only 15kgs as a weight limit. This weight is equal to 33 Pounds. This weight includes both your duffel bag and a daypack.\nThis means you need to pack and prepare your luggage wisely. We suggest you not to exceed the limit to avoid an additional cost of USD 2 to USD 5 per kg.\nHow much money or cash you should be carrying with you depends on how you do the trip and the number of days you want to spend here in Nepal. Much also depends on your spending habits.\nGenerally, you can have your lunch and dinner in 10 to 15 USD. How much you will be spending during your trekking depends on the standard of the package you have purchased. If it is a full board or budget package you have chosen. Normally, Our experience tells that that 15 to 18 USA will be enough for a trekker who has purchased a board package to buy bottles of water, chocolates, pay for hot showers, and a few drinks during the trek. If you buy a budget package, you pay for your meals on your own. For this, you need to spend USD 25 to 35 per day.\nNeedless to say, we can help you explore plenty of options and choices to extend your holiday. We can help you enjoy your time before you make the main trip and after you complete your main trip.\nHow much you should give a tip to your trekking guide depends upon the level of satisfaction you have gained from their service. We would like to suggest you make a human relationship with your guide and porters. Generally, we have found that trekkers tip from USD 20 to USD 500 per person for their guides and porters. We would like to remind you that tipping is not required. But a small gesture of thanks to your guides and local porters will make you as well as them happy. We recommend that spending 10% of your total trip cost for tipping entire local staff, the ratio of tipping guide, and porter would be a wise thing.\nWe would like to repeat again that how much you should tip your trekking guide and porters is depended upon the level of satisfaction you have gained.\nTourists coming to Nepal do not need to go through any specific immunization process. But it is best to get vaccinated before you come to Nepal.\nYou should book the service at least 15 days prior to tour departure date. After you confirm your trip with us, you should be sending us a photocopy of your passport or your personal information. The personal information you provide must contain your surname, name, and date of birth, passport number, nationality and gender clearly. Importantly, you need to pay the 20% of the total price in advance for the domestic flight tickets and hotel booking and permit process. You can pay the remaining balance after you arrive in Nepal.\nIn case you want to cancel already confirmed booking you should inform us through written documents or electronic mail. After we receive the document then only we will be in position to cancel your trip. We would like to inform you that 30% of the trip amount that you have paid in advance will be charged as the cancellation fee.\nWe are professionals. We remained committed to provide the best services to you. We try our best to make your trip pleasant and comfortable.\nTherefore, the Unique Path and its related organization shall not be responsible for any changes in the itinerary due to unavoidable circumstance such as government decisions.\nNeedless to say, the tour package may also be affected by political unrest, cancellation of flight, delay of flight, sickness or accident. For this, trekkers themselves need to bear the extra cost. What we can do is take care of your health, provide security and do our best to make your trip pleasant and comfortable. Thank you very much."

    "content": "Choosing the ideal time for the Everest Base Camp (EBC) trek is the difference between a cloudy, damp struggle and a breathtaking, life-changing adventure. While the Himalayas are stunning year-round, the region’s weather patterns dictate the safety, visibility, and overall comfort of your journey.\nThe best time to trek to Everest Base Camp (EBC) is during the two distinct peak seasons: Spring (March to May) and Autumn (mid-September to November) . These windows offer the most stable weather, clearest skies, and safest trail conditions.\nThe consensus among seasoned trekkers and guides is clear: Spring (March–May) and Autumn (September–November) are the best times to visit. These windows offer the most consistent weather, clearest skies, and safest conditions.\nSpring is arguably the most popular time for the EBC trek. It coincides with the main Everest climbing season, giving the region a unique, high-stakes energy.\nThe Experience: You’ll witness the lower altitudes burst into color with blooming rhododendrons and lush greenery within Sagarmatha National Park.\nTemperature: Daytime temperatures can reach a comfortable 20°C , though nights remain cold, hovering around 5°C or lower.\nKey Advantage: This season offers a high “weather window” probability, meaning fewer flight cancellations to Lukla and crisp, blue-sky views of the peaks.\nThe Trade-off: The trails and teahouses are at their busiest. Solo trekkers may find it difficult to secure a bed without a guide’s pre-booked arrangements.\nPro Tip: Dress in layers. You’ll want moisture-wicking base layers for the warm daytime sun and a heavy down jacket for the biting chill of the early mornings.\nAfter the summer rains wash away the dust, the air in the Himalayas becomes incredibly sharp and clear, providing the best photographic conditions of the year.\nTrekking during the summer monsoon is a vastly different experience and is generally recommended only for those who prioritize solitude over scenery.\nWeather & Visibility: Expect heavy rain below 3,500m and unpredictable conditions higher up. Clouds often obscure the mountain views you’ve traveled so far to see.\nThe Trails: Paths can become muddy and slippery. Leeches are common at lower elevations, and domestic flights to Lukla face frequent delays or cancellations due to poor visibility.\nTemperature: While it is warm (averaging 18°C ), the dampness can make the cold feel more penetrative once the sun goes down.\nThe primary benefit of a monsoon trek is the silence . The trails are empty, teahouses are wide open, and the landscape is incredibly lush. If you aren’t on a strict timeline and don’t mind the rain, you get a version of the Everest region that very few people ever see.\nStart Early: In the Himalayas, clouds usually build up in the afternoon. Aim to be on the trail by sunrise to catch the clearest views.\nHydrate & Acclimatize: Temperature fluctuations can tax your body. Drink plenty of water and never skip your scheduled rest days.\nPack for “Worst Case”: Even in the height of spring, a sudden storm can drop temperatures below freezing. Always carry high-quality waterproofs and a reliable down jacket.\nDeciding when to trek to Everest Base Camp (EBC) is a balance between weather, crowd levels, and your own comfort with extreme conditions. While the peak seasons of Spring and Autumn are the gold standard, each time of year offers a unique perspective on the world’s tallest mountain.\nEarly Starts: Aim to be on the trail at sunrise. In the Himalayas, monsoon rain typically hits in the afternoon, so getting your miles in early ensures a drier trek.\nLeech & Moisture Protection: Lower altitudes (below 3,500m) can be buggy. Wear long sleeves, use insect repellent, and pack dry bags to keep your electronics and sleeping bag bone-dry.\nFootwear Focus: Ensure your boots have deep treads for slippery mud and are fully waterproof. Trekking poles are non-negotiable for stability on wet descents.\nThe “Rain-Shadow” Alternative: If you want to trek in Nepal during these months but avoid the rain, consider routes like Upper Mustang or Dolpo , which stay dry while the rest of the country is soaked.\nUnrivaled Clarity: After the monsoon, the air is scrubbed clean of dust, offering the sharpest views of Everest, Lhotse, and Ama Dablam.\nFestive Spirit: You’ll likely witness major Nepalese festivals like Dashain and Tihar , adding a rich cultural layer to your adventure.\nWeather Trends: Expect mild days (12°C to 16°C) but be prepared for a sharp drop into sub-zero temperatures as soon as the sun sets.\nNote on Crowds: Because this is the most popular window, teahouses in Namche Bazaar and Dingboche fill up fast. Always book your accommodation in advance through a reputable agency.\nExtreme Temperatures: Nights at Base Camp can plummet to -20°C (-4°F) . A high-quality, four-season sleeping bag and a heavy down jacket are mandatory.\nThe “Closed” Factor: Some high-altitude teahouses close for the winter. Ensure your guide has confirmed which lodges are open to avoid being stranded.\nBattery Life: Cold drains electronics rapidly. Keep your phone and power banks inside your sleeping bag at night to preserve their charge.\nRegardless of the season, Altitude Sickness (AMS) remains the primary risk. The cold, dry air of winter can exacerbate respiratory issues, while the humidity of the monsoon can lead to faster fatigue. Always include buffer days in your itinerary—especially in winter and monsoon seasons when Lukla flights are frequently grounded due to visibility."

For blooming rhododendrons and vibrant wildlife, Spring (March–May) is ideal. Plan your 2026 Himalayan adventure with our complete weather and seasonal guide. Choosing the best time for your Langtang Valley trek is all about matching your goals—whether that’s vibrant flowers, sharp mountain photography, or peaceful solitude—with the right season.\nWhy go: This is when the rhododendrons (Nepal’s national flower) bloom in shades of red, pink, and white, especially between Lama Hotel and Ghodatabela.\nConditions: Daytime is mild 15 ° -20 ° C though higher spots like Kyanjin Gompa remain chilly. You’ll see baby yaks in the pastures and active wildlife like the Red Panda or Himalayan Monal.\nWhy go: After the monsoon rains wash away the dust, the air is the clearest it will be all year. The visibility of Langtang Lirung 7,245m and Dorje Lakpa 6,990m is stunning.\nConditions: Crisp mornings and sunny days. This is the busiest time on the trail, so expect a lively atmosphere in the teahouses.\nConditions: It is extremely cold . At Kyanjin Gompa, nighttime temperatures can drop to -15^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ or lower. Some teahouses may close, and you’ll need microspikes for icy trail sections.\nCurrent Status (January 2026): We are currently in the peak of winter. While the skies are crystal clear, the trails above Ghodatabela are likely draped in snow.\nConditions: Expect daily rain, clouds obscuring the peaks, and leeches in the lower forest sections. However, the waterfalls are at their most powerful and the valley is an intense, vibrant green.\nAutumn is often called the “Golden Season” for the Langtang Valley Trek because it offers the most stable conditions and crystal-clear Himalayan views. If you are planning for Autumn 2026 , here is what you need to know to time your trip perfectly.\nAutumn is also the season of Nepal’s biggest festivals. If you want to witness the local Tamang and Hindu cultures at their most vibrant, aim for these dates:\nNote: The trail is beautiful, but public transport from Kathmandu to Syabrubesi can be very crowded as locals travel home to their villages.\nUnmatched Clarity: The summer rains have washed the dust from the air, providing high-definition views of Langtang Lirung 7,245 m and Dorje Lakpa .\nIdeal Hiking Weather: Daytime temperatures stay between 10 ° -15 ° c (50 ° -59 ° F), which is perfect for active walking without overheating.\nHarvest Time: You will see locals busy in the fields harvesting buckwheat and barley, offering a deeper look into mountain life.\nBusy Teahouses: October is the most popular month. If you are trekking solo, you may have to share a room or sleep in the dining hall if you don’t book ahead.\nShortening Days: By November, the sun sets earlier. You’ll need to start your trekking days by 7:30 AM to reach your destination well before dark.\nDusty Trails: Since it hasn’t rained for weeks, the lower parts of the trail (near Syabrubesi) can be dusty. Bring a Buff or face mask to protect your lungs.\nFreezing Nights: While days are sunny, temperatures at Kyanjin Gompa will drop below O °C(32°F) as soon as the sun goes down. A quality sleeping bag is mandatory.\nIf you missed the autumn window, winter offers total silence. However, be prepared for extreme cold -15 ° C at night and potential snow blocking the path to the high viewpoints like Tserko Ri .\nToday in Langtang , the weather is currently sunny with a temperature of 1°C . The wind is blowing from the west at 2 mph , and the humidity is 15% .\nFor the rest of the day, Friday, January 16, 2026, conditions will remain sunny with a high of 1°C and a clear night dropping to -8°C .\nSunday, January 18: The weather will be mostly sunny with a 5% chance of snow during the day. Temperatures will range from a high of -2°C to a low of -13°C .\nExtreme Cold: Nighttime temperatures at higher altitudes like Kyanjin Gompa are reaching -13°C this week. High-quality thermal layers and a sleeping bag rated for at least -15°C are essential.\nTrail Safety: Sunny days can melt snow that refreezes into ice overnight. Carry crampons or microspikes for traction, especially near shaded slopes and high viewpoints like Tserko Ri.\nShort Days: With limited daylight, aim to start your hike by 7:30 AM to ensure you reach the next teahouse before the post-noon temperature drop.\nLangtang Valley Trek is a scenic Himalayan journey situated just north of Kathmandu, making it an ideal adventure for both beginne\nLangtang Heritage Trek is an enthralling journey in Langtang Valley of Nepal that offers an excellent combination of stunning vist\nGosaikunda Lake trek combines the remote and spectacular valley of Langtang, with the high mountain lakes at Gosainkund.

    "content": "The Everest Base Camp Trek is the ultimate pilgrimage for adventurers, a journey that transports you from the bustling streets of Kathmandu to the rugged, awe-inspiring South Base Camp of Mount Everest (8,848.86 m) .\nWhile some choose the high cost of a helicopter, the true spirit of the Himalayas is found on foot. Our 14-day itinerary is meticulously designed to offer a balanced, safe, and deeply rewarding experience. From the legendary flight into Lukla to the final steps onto the Khumbu Glacier, this trek is a challenge that rewards you with the world’s most spectacular mountain theater, featuring giants like Lhotse (8,516 m) , Nuptse (7,861 m) , and the elegant Ama Dablam .\nEmbark on the definitive mountain adventure to the foot of the world’s highest peak. Our 14-day guided trek takes you through the heart of the Khumbu region, reaching the iconic Everest Base Camp (5,364m) and the breathtaking vantage point of Kala Patthar (5,545m) for the ultimate sunrise view of Mt. Everest.\nCultural Immersion: Walk through historic Sherpa villages and experience the world-renowned hospitality and traditions of the mountain people.\nSagarmatha National Park: Traverse a UNESCO World Heritage site home to rare flora, fauna, and diverse altitudinal landscapes.\nNamche Bazaar: Explore the vibrant “Sherpa Capital,” a bustling horseshoe-shaped town perched on a steep mountain slope.\nSpiritual Landmarks: Visit the Tengboche Monastery , the spiritual heart of the region, and numerous ancient chortens along the trail.\nMountaineering Spirit: During peak season, witness the “City of Tents” as international expeditions prepare to summit the world’s highest peak.\nStarting from Lukla , our trail follows a well-established path through Phakding, Namche, Tengboche, Dingboche, and Lobuche , before reaching the final settlement of Gorakshep . This route is preferred for its safety, superior infrastructure, and the camaraderie of fellow trekkers from around the globe.\nWhen to Go: The premier windows are Spring (March to mid-May) and Autumn (late September to late November) . These months offer crystal-clear skies, stable temperatures, and the best photographic conditions.\nDifficulty: Rated as Moderate . While the trail is well-maintained, the high altitude and mountainous terrain require a good level of physical preparation.\nExpert Guidance: we have successfully guided over 200 adventurers to Base Camp. Our experienced high-altitude guides ensure your safety and can customize the pace to suit your fitness level.\nThis is more than a trek; it is an immersion into the “Himalayan Giants.” You will navigate through vibrant Sherpa villages, ancient monasteries, and high-altitude landscapes. Whether it’s the thrill of the Lukla flight or the quiet determination of the climb to Kala Patthar, every step is designed to challenge and inspire you.\nTo ensure a successful journey to the roof of the world, proper preparation is key. Below is a comprehensive guide on what to pack, where you will stay, and what you will eat during your 14-day adventure.\nWhile you can rent high-quality sleeping bags and down jackets in Kathmandu, we recommend bringing the following essentials:\nThe flight from Kathmandu to Lukla is the traditional start of the trek. However, due to government regulations during peak seasons ( mid-March to mid-May and mid-September to mid-December ), flights often operate from Ramechhap Airport instead.\nThe Journey: Since Ramechhap is roughly a 4–5 hour drive from Kathmandu, we depart by private bus at 1:00 AM to catch the early morning flights.\nIn Kathmandu: 2 nights in a quality 3-star hotel in Thamel . Rooms are twin-share with attached bathrooms, hot water, and inclusive breakfast.\nElectricity & Showers: Most teahouses use solar power. You should expect to pay $3–$5 to charge your devices or for a hot shower, as gas and equipment must be carried up by porters.\nYou will be surprised by the variety of food available even at high altitudes. Most teahouses offer a mix of local and international cuisines.\nLunch & Dinner: Dal Bhat (the trekker’s favorite—lentil soup, rice, and curry), Momos (dumplings), Thukpa (noodle soup), pasta, and potato dishes.\nPro Safety Tip: Above 3,000m (Namche Bazaar), we strongly recommend avoiding meat products . Because there is no refrigeration at these heights, sticking to fresh vegetarian meals like Dal Bhat is the safest way to avoid stomach issues.\nWhile adventurers journey to Everest Base Camp year-round, the experience changes dramatically with the seasons. Choosing the right time depends on your tolerance for cold, your desire for clear views, and whether you prefer a social trail or total solitude.\nThe Experience: This is the most popular time for mountaineering. You’ll see the “city of tents” at Base Camp as climbers prepare for the summit.\nThe Experience: Post-monsoon, the dust is settled and the air is incredibly crisp. This is widely considered the best time for photography .\nThe Experience: Trekking during the rains is for the resilient traveler looking for a unique, lush perspective of the Himalayas.\nFor the Solitude Seeker: December or February provides a majestic, quiet experience if you bring the right thermal gear.\nStepping onto the Everest trail is a transition into a different rhythm of life. Understanding the daily flow and the administrative side of the trek ensures you can focus entirely on the majestic surroundings.\nThe Early Start (6:00 – 7:00 AM): Mornings begin early to catch the best weather and mountain views. Breakfast is usually pre-ordered the night before to ensure a quick departure.\nThe Transition: You hand over your main duffel bag to your porter , who moves ahead at his own pace. You carry only a light daypack containing essentials like water, sunscreen, a camera, and an extra layer.\nThe Journey: You hike with your guide, who shares insights into the terrain and culture. Most days include a mid-morning hike followed by a lunch stop at a scenic trail settlement.\nEvening Wind-down: Upon reaching your teahouse, you have time to relax, socialize with fellow trekkers, or journal. Dinner is served in the communal hall, followed by a briefing from your guide regarding the next day’s route and safety.\nTo preserve the fragile ecosystem of the Himalayas and support local infrastructure, two specific permits are required for every trekker:\nAltitude is the most significant factor on the EBC trek. You begin at 2,860m (Lukla) and quickly ascend to 3,440m (Namche Bazaar) . To help your body adapt to the thinning air, our itinerary includes two strategic “Acclimatization Days.”\nThe Strategy: We follow the “Climb High, Sleep Low” philosophy. On rest days in Namche Bazaar and Dingboche , we take short, higher-altitude hikes during the day but return to the same teahouse to sleep.\nSafety Monitoring: Our guides are trained to recognize early symptoms of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) . They carry oximeters to monitor your blood oxygen saturation levels regularly.\nYour Responsibility: Stay well-hydrated (3–4 liters of water daily) and communicate even the slightest headache or dizziness to your guide immediately.\nTrekking to Everest Base Camp is a physical challenge balanced by deep cultural rewards. To reach the base of the world’s highest peak safely, you must understand the demands of the altitude, the preparation required, and the traditions of the people who call these mountains home.\nThe journey begins at 2,860m (9,383ft) in Lukla and reaches its zenith at 5,545m (18,192ft) on Kala Patthar. This rapid ascent places significant stress on the human body.\nStrategic Acclimatization: We build two mandatory rest days into every itinerary: Namche Bazaar (3,440m) and Dingboche (4,410m) . These stops allow your respiratory and circulatory systems to adapt.\nExpert Oversight: Our guides have a minimum of seven years of experience in high-altitude leading. They use oximeters to monitor your oxygen saturation and are trained to spot early signs of distress.\nEmergency Protocols: If symptoms of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)—such as persistent headache, nausea, or dizziness—arise, our protocol is clear: Stop, Rest, and if necessary, Descend immediately.\nThe EBC Trek is classified as Strenuous . While it is a “walk-up” (no technical climbing), it covers 130 km (80 miles) of rugged, steep terrain.\nCardiovascular Stamina: You will hike 5–7 hours daily . Training should begin 2–3 months before your trip, focusing on swimming, cycling, or running.\nLeg & Core Strength: Incorporate squats, lunges, and planks. High-altitude trekking requires stability on uneven rocky paths.\nMental Resilience: Success on Everest depends as much on a positive mindset and patience as it does on physical strength.\nWho can go? We have successfully guided trekkers ranging from 12 to 70+ years old . Whether you are a beginner or a veteran, the key is a slow, steady pace and proper preparation.\nTengboche Monastery (3,867m): The spiritual heart of the Khumbu. Trekkers are often welcome to observe morning or evening prayers amidst views of Ama Dablam.\nMani Walls & Stupas: You will pass numerous stone carvings and prayer wheels. Always walk to the left (clockwise) around these structures as a mark of respect.\nBeyond the trail, take time to visit the Khumbu Museum in Namche Bazaar or share a cup of yak butter tea in a local teahouse. These interactions offer a window into a lifestyle defined by harmony with the world’s harshest environment.\nWhile the trail to Everest is legendary, there isn’t just one way to experience it. Depending on your timeframe, fitness level, and thirst for adventure, you can choose from several distinct routes and variations.\nThis is the Classic Everest Base Camp Trek . It begins with a mountain flight to Lukla and follows the traditional spine of the Khumbu Valley. It is the gold standard for balancing safety, cultural immersion, and scenery.\nIdeal for those short on time but high on ambition. You trek to Base Camp and Kala Patthar as usual, but instead of walking back down, you fly out by helicopter from Gorakshep or Lobuche.\nThe ultimate “express” option. Fly from Kathmandu, hover over Base Camp, land at Kala Patthar for photos, and enjoy breakfast at the Everest View Hotel.\nFollow the footsteps of Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary. This “pioneers’ route” starts in the mid-hills and walks into the Khumbu.\nIsland Peak Climb (6,189m): Combine your trek with an entry-level mountaineering peak. This adds 3–4 days and requires basic climbing gear.\nAma Dablam Base Camp: A spectacular half-day detour from Pangboche to see one of the world’s most beautiful mountains up close.\nHelicopter “Fly-Back”: You can decide mid-trek to fly back to Lukla or Kathmandu from almost any village to save time or avoid the knee-taxing descent.\nWith us, we believe in transparent pricing and a seamless booking experience. Our all-inclusive package is designed to let you focus on the mountains while we handle the logistics.\nThis price is carefully structured to provide the best value without compromising on safety or quality. Your trek package includes:\nSecure Your Spot: Pay a 20% deposit online via our secure payment gateway (all major credit cards accepted). You also have the option to pay the full amount upfront.\nSubmit Documents: Send us a digital copy of your passport . This is essential for us to pre-book your Lukla flight tickets and process your trekking permits immediately.\nGet Confirmation: Once confirmed, you will receive a comprehensive Trip Briefing Pack , a detailed packing list, and our 24/7 support contact information.\nThe journey of a lifetime is just a few clicks away. Whether you have more questions or are ready to lock in your 2026 trekking dates, we are here to help.\nIn our EBC/Gokyo Lake Heli Trek Package, we combine the EBC Trek and the Gokyo Valley Trek, which takes us to the tranquil Gokyo V\nThis EBC/Gokyo Lake Budget Trek package combines EBC Trek and Gokyo Valley trek into one which first takes us to the foot of world"

These treks usually stay below 3,000 meters, which helps reduce the risk of altitude sickness and makes the journey more comfortable. The walking hours are typically short, ranging from two to five hours per day, and the trails are well-marked with gentle ascents and descents. Trekkers can enjoy comfortable teahouse accommodations along the way and experience the warmth of local hospitality.\nDuring these treks, you’ll witness panoramic mountain views, including peaks like Annapurna, Machapuchare, and Langtang, even without climbing to high altitudes.

Popular routes include the classic Everest Base Camp (EBC) Trek, which offers iconic sunrise views from Kala Patthar; the Gokyo Lakes Trek, featuring six alpine lakes and rich Sherpa heritage; and the demanding Everest Three Passes Trek for panoramic vistas from Renjo La, Cho La, and Kongma La. For a shorter journey, the Everest View Trek offers stunning mountain landscapes with less hiking.\nEverest trekking is the ultimate adventure for thrill-seekers and nature lovers alike. Nestled in eastern Nepal, the Everest region lies entirely within Sagarmatha National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1976. This stunning expanse spans over 1,148 square kilometers, rising from 2,845 meters (9,330 ft) to the world’s highest point, Mount Everest, at its official height of 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 ft).\nMount Everest, locally known as Sagarmatha or “Goddess Mother of the World,” stands as a sacred symbol of strength and spirituality in the Himalayas.

We will reach Dhunche, where there are numerous teahouses and facilities, after a roughly six to seven-hour lengthy drive. We need to register at the checkpoint center and the National Park Office.\nStarting in Dhunche, we hike up to Thulo Bharkhu along a wide motorway trail. To get to Barbal, our trail ascends sharply through dense oak and pine forest. From there, our hike follows a simple, undulating path through a temperate forest with sporadic views of Langtang valley and Ganesh Himal.

Some lodges also have oxygen available at various locations. Generally, people use oxygen if mild symptoms worsen. In the mountains, we do not allow clients to remain in such conditions. Before reaching this stage, we take clients to lower altitudes where they feel safer or transport them to Kathmandu by helicopter for further treatment.

The trail then follows glacial streams to the snout of the Imja glacier.

Starting before dawn after having breakfast and then scrambling up an open gully leads between two well-defined ridges of a small hanging glacier at 5,280m /17,323ft. Care should be taken to avoid possible avalanche danger from the ice above. From this point of left-hand ridge scramble across the broad open gully and gain the right-hand ridge. Following this, this gives easy scrambling to the snow-covered glacier above. A route needs to be found out leftwards, avoiding seracs and crevasses before turning back northwards over snow-covered scree in the margin between the glacier and the base of the main summit ridge. After crossing a gully with some stone and icefall danger, a steep snow and ice ramp leads upwards for nearly 100 meters (300ft), to the summit ridge. The last moves on to the ridge often prove difficult and many climbers leave a fixed rope in place to aid descent. The ridge itself is a classic and undulates towards the main summit which is reached by a final tricky snow pitch. Standing atop we have the stunning close-up view of the South face of Lhotse (8,501 m.) in the vastness that looms before us.

Temperatures during this period in the Nepali mountains remain relatively warm 10° to 15°, much warmer than the one you experience during the winter. The most important thing about this season is that mornings mostly remain bright and clear. The afternoons remain mostly filled with warm air. The rhododendron forests in springtime create a spectacular scene. You can experience the wild and natural “Himalayan” beauty. Needless to say, June is much warmer and greener.\nAnother best season for trekking in the Nepal is from second week of September to last week of November. This is often regarded as the ideal time for the panoramic view of mountains. Days during these months typically remain sunny and clear. Moderate temperatures and comparatively cool evenings make the experience of trekking and climbing in this part of the world quite unique.\nIt is considered moderately difficult, with some technical sections that require climbers to use ropes and other climbing gear. A good level of strength and cardiovascular fitness is essential. Aim to exercise by cycling or running for at least 30 minutes, three times a week. Complement this with endurance or lower body strengthening workouts at the gym. Additionally, ensure you can carry a 10 kg load during the trip.\nDuring the trekking portion, you’ll be accommodated in local lodges, while for the climbing segment, you’ll be staying in tents.\nWhile trekking to Everest Base Camp, it is not necessary to carry an oxygen cylinder. There are two well-established hospitals operated by international INGO teams in Khumjung and Pheriche, as well as two smaller hospitals in Namche and Lukla. Additionally, there is a small clinic in Gorak Shep, which is near Everest Base Camp. In case people need oxygen, they can obtain it from these facilities. Some lodges also have oxygen available at various locations. Generally, people use oxygen if mild symptoms worsen. In the mountains, we do not allow clients to remain in such conditions. Before reaching this stage, we take clients to lower altitudes where they feel safer or transport them to Kathmandu by helicopter for further treatment. The designed itinerary helps with acclimatization. Normally, people can complete the trip with only minor symptoms."

Lobuche Peak, one of Nepal’s most famous trekking peaks, is an ideal first step into Himalayan mountaineering. It demands simple technical abilities and provides an exciting yet attainable experience.\nIt is considered moderately difficult, with some technical sections that require climbers to use ropes and other climbing gear. A good level of strength and cardiovascular fitness is essential. Aim to exercise by cycling or running for at least 30 minutes, three times a week. Complement this with endurance or lower body strengthening workouts at the gym. Additionally, ensure you can carry a 10 kg load during the trek and climbing.\nIt is not necessary to carry an oxygen cylinder. There are two well-established hospitals operated by international INGO teams in Khumjung and Pheriche, as well as two smaller hospitals in Namche and Lukla. Additionally, there is a small clinic in Gorak Shep, which is near Everest Base Camp. In case people need oxygen, they can obtain it from these facilities. Some lodges also have oxygen available at various locations. Generally, people use oxygen if mild symptoms worsen. In the mountains, we do not allow clients to remain in such conditions. Before reaching this stage, we take clients to lower altitudes where they feel safer or transport them to Kathmandu by helicopter for further treatment. The designed itinerary helps with acclimatization. Normally, people can complete this trip with only minor symptoms."

    "content": "Makalu Trekking in eastern Nepal lies within the Makalu-Barun National Park and Conservation Area, established in 1992 and spanning 2,330 square kilometers. This protected region shelters 16 majestic peaks, including Mount Makalu (8,485m / 27,838ft), the world’s fifth-highest mountain. Once a restricted area, the park now offers trekkers access to five distinct ecological zones, ranging from the lush tropical Arun Valley and dense rhododendron forests to fir woodlands, alpine meadows, and the icy expanse of the Barun Glacier. From base camp, visitors are rewarded with spectacular views of Makalu itself, along with rare glimpses of the Kangshung Face of Everest.\nCentered on the Arun Valley, the trek begins in the subtropical lowlands at around 850m, where the valley floor is densely forested and the terraced slopes are cultivated by diverse Rai and Sherpa communities. As the trail climbs higher, it passes through high pastures and rugged terrain bordering the Makalu-Barun National Park, a vital sanctuary for endangered species. The journey rises steadily to altitudes of nearly 5,000m, demanding stamina and acclimatization.\nThis challenging 18 day expedition starts with a flight from Kathmandu to Tumlingtar and a drive to Chichila, before plunging into the humid, biodiversity-rich Arun River valley. The route ascends steeply through villages like Seduwa and Tashi Gaon, crossing into the high-altitude wilderness of the park. Beyond, trekkers tackle the formidable Shipton La Pass (≈4,216m), then descend into the breathtaking Barun Valley, a glacial U-shaped gorge renowned for its towering cliffs and massive waterfalls. The trail culminates at Makalu Base Camp (≈4,870m), where trekkers stand in awe beneath the mighty pyramid of Makalu, before retracing the path through quiet, less-commercialized terrain back to Tumlingtar and finally returning to Kathmandu.\nMakalu trek begins in Kathmandu, with a short flight east to Tumlingtar, followed by a drive to Chichila, a small Gurung village that serves as the trailhead. From here, the path descends into the lush Arun River valley, where humid subtropical forests are alive with orchids, rhododendrons, and countless bird species. The early days pass through villages like Seduwa, the gateway to Makalu-Barun National Park, and Tashi Gaon, the last permanent settlement on the route, where Rai and Sherpa families welcome trekkers with traditional hospitality.\nBeyond Tashi Gaon, the trail steepens dramatically, climbing through dense forests into alpine meadows. The ascent to Shipton La Pass (4,216m) is one of the trek’s toughest sections, with multiple ridges to cross before reaching the pass itself. From the top, the views stretch across snow peaks and valleys, before the trail drops into the remote Barun Valley. This valley is a highlight of the trek ,a glacial U-shaped gorge lined with sheer cliffs, cascading waterfalls, and wildflowers in spring.\nAs you continue deeper into the valley, the landscape becomes stark and rugged, with yak pastures and moraine fields leading toward Makalu Base Camp (≈4,870m). Here, trekkers stand beneath the towering pyramid of Mount Makalu (8,485m), the world’s fifth-highest peak, with rare glimpses of the Kangshung Face of Everest in the distance. The base camp is raw and remote, offering a true expedition feel far from the crowds of Everest or Annapurna.\nThe return journey retraces the same path, allowing trekkers to see the landscapes in reverse light and perspective, waterfalls glistening differently, villages offering a second warm welcome, and the forests alive with new sounds. Eventually, the trail leads back to Chichila, then Tumlingtar, and finally a flight returns you to Kathmandu, completing an unforgettable 18 day adventure."

From Khare, you climb gradually to Mera Base Camp (5,300m) and, following a rest, onwards to High Camp (5,780m), with magnificent views of Everest, Makalu, and Baruntse. Then follows summit day, a tough but rewarding ascent on glaciers to the top of Mera Peak (6,476m), where mountaineers are rewarded with a spectacular 360-degree panorama of five of the world’s highest mountains.\nThere is also a bonus day in the schedule, which serves as a weather buffer, boosting summit success rates. Following day, you go down to Khothey via the picturesque Hinku Valley, then back to Thuli Kharka. Crossing the Zatrawala Pass once more, you drop down to Lukla, where you celebrate the successful end of your adventure. A return flight to Kathmandu constitutes the last stage, where you relax, shop, or tour prior to departure."

We must take a number of tiny snow steps. As we move eastward, we will eventually emerge at the top of the ridge’s tapering point after passing through the ground. We will continue to the ridge’s summit and turn westward from there. Later, we will ascend to the top of the yellow tower by following the simple trail on the eastern face. We will arrive at Camp 2 after a moderately challenging ascent of the route. Camp 2 to Camp 3 (6,300m/20,770ft): We’ll head to the gray tower by heading east. We can reach an amphitheater by carefully ascending the tower. We will climb higher up the gully to the snow slope and then proceed to the mushroom ridge, where Camp 2.7 is located (6300m). Camp 3 to Summit (6,812m/22,350ft): Leaving Camp, we will walk through a crevasse in the upper face and climb the ice slope to the right of Dablam. We will head west and arrive at the small snowfield located below Bergschrund. Crossing it, we will reach the top of the highest-hanging glacier. A final trail through an ice crest will take us to the summit.

We hope that our endeavor has made your experience more enjoyable.\nThe South-Western Ridge is the path typically taken to ascend Ama Dablam; Ward (UK), Bishop (USA), and Gill (NZ) used this route to conquer the mountain for the first time in 1961. The route offers a steady climb with a variety of ascents and a manageable degree of difficulty. At key locations, three high camps have been established. The ascent is easy until Camp 1, after which it becomes difficult as it continues up the jagged granite ridge. The path becomes more technical after Camp 2 and requires negotiating pitches of steep ice and snow slopes. From Camp 3, circumnavigate the hanging glacier or the Dablam, traverse a snow arête and a bergschrund between ice cliffs, and then climb to the summit.\nThe South-Western Ridge is the path typically taken to ascend Ama Dablam; Ward (UK), Bishop (USA), and Gill (NZ) used this route to conquer the mountain for the first time in 1961.

The Everest region’s Mount Nuptse Expedition is a Technical & Serious Climb. The following common elements influence how challenging the Mt. Nuptse Expedition is: Nuptse Climbing Challenges It is difficult to climb Mount Nuptse or Nubtse since the summit is quite dangerous due to loose snow and numerous hollows. It is challenging for climbers to reach the peak of Mount Nuptse because of the snow cornices’ shaky attachments. Climbing Mount Nuptse Mount Nuptse, the main peak Nuptse I(7861 m) was first summited by a British expedition Group via the North-ridge Route (Scott-route) on 16 May 1961 by Dennis Davis and Sherpa Tashi. However, until September 1996, the Nuptse summit received only two more expeditions. The next attempt for climbing Nuptse was done by a joint British/Nepalese Army team following the same Scott Route in 1975 but again the expedition team fell from the final couloir, making the expedition to summit as unsuccessful. The expedition remained unsuccessful probably of having been knocked off by a stone fall or snow slide.\nThe Everest region’s Mount Nuptse Expedition is a Technical & Serious Climb.

In the evening, enjoy a farewell supper and cultural performance with a group of Himalayan trekkers at a genuine Nepali restaurant.\nToday is a free day, so you may explore some of Kathmandu’s historical landmarks or wander through Thamel to finish up any last-minute shopping and pick up some gifts for loved ones.\nIn the evening, enjoy a farewell supper and cultural performance with a group of Himalayan trekkers at a genuine Nepali restaurant.\nAny summit’s difficulty will vary depending on a variety of variables, including the terrain, the climber’s physical condition, the mountaineering techniques used, the climber’s susceptibility to high altitude sickness, the distance to be covered, clothing, and equipment.\nMt. Pumori is one of the most challenging peaks above 7000 meters when taking into account these common variables and technical difficulties. The tough parts between Camps 1 and 2 and the challenging weather at such a high altitude make the Pumori Expedition challenging as well.\nThe weather in the Himalayas can be erratic and harsh. The best value of time and season must be taken into account when exploring the rough and untamed nature of high altitudes. Expeditions are additionally dangerous adventures. Therefore, that has a set deadline for implementation. Expeditions are typically performed in Nepal during two distinct seasons. Autumn and spring, respectively.\nThe best time to embark on an excursion in Nepal is in the early spring, between April and May. The weather will be at its most vibrant during this time thanks to the beautiful view of the immense mountain panorama.\nCompared to other times of the year, the wind will not be as fierce and the track will be simpler to follow. Every hill turns crimson and scarlet with rhododendron blooming as wildflowers proliferate, and plants and trees begin to turn green.\nMountaineers favor the spring because it offers a fantastic perspective of the area, is simpler to access, and has a high success rate.\nAnother fantastic time of year to climb peaks is from October through November during the autumnal season. Another fantastic time of year to climb peaks is from October through November during the autumnal season. The second busiest period of the year is now. Temperatures gradually drop after the wet monsoon season, the sky brightens, and the hills begin to turn yellow and brown.\nThe success rate also increases in the autumn since ropes, ladders, and camps are easy to set up and connect. With a brilliant blue sky, less heat haze, and breathtaking views of the world’s highest peaks in the distance, the trekking paths wind through verdant slopes.\nOn a twin/double sharing basis, we provide the best three standard category hotels in Kathmandu with breakfast. However, it can be changed following prior requests with a change in price if climbers choose a single supplementary for the duration of their holiday in Kathmandu.\nWe will stay in the best accessible tea houses and lodges that are tidy, clean, and sanitary till we reach Pumori Base Camp after landing in the Khumbu district and the Everest region. All of these are set up for twin or double sharing, and the majority have attached bathrooms and hot showers.\nSome of these hotels, particularly in Lukla and Namche Bazaar, feature the amenities you’d expect from a five-star hotel, as well as some great restaurants. Also, we will start at tented camps for the rest of the climbing period.\nThe lodging that is offered as part of the package includes breakfast. While trekkers in Kathmandu can pick from a broad variety of cuisines and restaurants, cafes, and pubs, lunch, supper, and drinks are informal for them.\nHowever, all three meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) are included in the package price during the Pumori Expedition period."

First ascended in 1955 via the northwest ridge, this 6,273m snow peak rewards climbers with panoramic views of Everest, Gaurishankar, Melungtse, and Makalu. The journey begins with a scenic trek through Rolwaling Valley, followed by acclimatization and a glacier traverse over Tashi Lapcha Pass to reach base camp at Tashiphuk.\nPharchamo Peak climbing offers a thrilling alpine adventure in Nepal’s remote Rolwaling Valley, just south of the Tashi Lapcha Pass. First ascended in 1955 via the northwest ridge, this 6,273m snow peak rewards climbers with panoramic views of Everest, Gaurishankar, Melungtse, and Makalu. The journey begins with a scenic trek through Rolwaling Valley, followed by acclimatization and a glacier traverse over Tashi Lapcha Pass to reach base camp at Tashiphuk. From there, a 4-hour summit push leads to breathtaking Himalayan vistas. Ideal for experienced mountaineers, Pharchamo is one of Nepal’s least crowded peaks. The route features dramatic ridgelines, crevassed glaciers, and cultural immersion in Rolwaling and Khumbu Valleys. After summiting, the descent continues through Ngole and Thame, ending with a trek to Lukla via Namche and Phakding.\nPharchamo is also known as Parchemuche, a renowned trekking site. It is a straightforward snow mountain located to the south of Tasi Lapcha. The Schneider Rolwaling Himal map does not identify it, although it is given a spot height of 6,187 meters. This mountain is named Parchoma on the Mandala Lamasangu to Everest map, which is most likely a mistake. According to both Shipton’s and Gregory’s expedition surveys, the summit is around 6,318 meters high. From the pass, the mountain appears to be a pleasant but undemanding snow peak with a well-defined north-by-northwest ridge rising from the Tesi Lapcha’s rather flat, crevassed glacier.\nThe first ascent of Pharchamo Peak took place in 1955. Crevasses rise from the stony lower buttresses above the Drolambau Glaciers in the west, breaking up the ridge’s consistent slope. The main route to Pharchamo Peak is by Rolwaling Valley, which was closed in the 1980s due to potential threats to porters crossing the Tashi Lapcha. The only other option is to go through Namche Bazaar and Thame on the Khumbu side. For trekkers crossing the high Tasi Lapcha (5755m) to Namche Bazaar in the Everest zone, Parchamo Peak has become an exciting climb.\nThis mountain can be coupled with the more difficult Ramdung Go summit and the Tesi Lapcha trip. The only other possible approach is from the Khumbu side via Namche Bazaar. We take the trekking trail to Thame and then Thengpo to Ngole to set up base camp on the moraines at 5100m height. As we climb, we come to another prospective campsite, but setting up camp is not recommended owing to frequent rock falls. We continue our thrilling trip by climbing northeast of the Tesi Lapcha icefall to just below the granite walls, where we set up camp on rocky terraces at 5,500 meters.\nWe reach the rim of Pacharmo Peak, which is raised from the Tesi Lapcha Pass glaciers, from here. Then we continue the ridge with less difficulty, however, the crevasses towards the peak can occasionally pose issues.\nOur Pharchamo Peak journey will end at the Lukla airstrip after descending through the ancient commercial center Namche Bazaar after a great Himalayan trekking experience. Unique Path Treks & Expedition” is delighted to design your Pharchamo Peak Climbing tour, complete with our professional climbing guides and competent personnel, for your enjoyment.\nThe picturesque Pharchamo or Pacharmo Peak (6187m) is south of Tashi Lapcha. It features a ridge from north to the west that rises from the crevassed glacier astride the Tashi Lapcha. The ridge’s face is broken by crevasse and series rising from the stony lower buttresses above the Drolambau Glaciers in the west, forming a consistent slope.\nThe major route to Pharchamo is through Rolwaling Valley, which was closed for most of the 1980s due to potential threats to porters crossing the Tashi Lapcha. The only other option is to go through Namche Bazar and Thame on the Khumbu side. In 1955, Pharchamo Peak was first climbed.\nUnique Path Team conducts Pharchamo peak climbing according to the client’s interests, budget, and time frame at a reasonable price.The highest altitude for Parchamo Peak Climbing is 6,187 Meters\nOn the first day of our journey, our organization’s frontman picks you up from Tribhuwan International Airport (Kathmandu), where you will be warmly received and transferred by our private car to a tourist-vehicle.\nAfter having our morning breakfast on the second day, we proceed to tour several historical places that are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Following our exploration of these areas, we return to Kathmandu to finalize our trekking equipment (trekking boots, down jackets, sleeping bags, ropes, harness, Ice ax, Crampons, and many other items) that will be needed during our future trek, and we spend this night at the same hotel.\nWe will leave Kathmandu today and travel to Gongor Khola. The picturesque drive provides breathtaking views of the surrounding natural treasures as well as the daily lives of the locals. The drive to Gongor Khola, the starting site of the trek, takes about eight hours.\nWe begin our trip at Gongor Khola, following a track that crosses the main path before ascending and descending through a dense forest of rhododendron, oaks, and pine trees. We’ll continue walking along the riverbank before crossing the suspension bridge and climbing a difficult incline to the settlement of Simigaun, which is mostly populated by Sherpas.\nWe’ll continue on the trail from Simigaun, passing through more Sherpa settlements. We continue on the trail, which leads through a beautiful pine forest before climbing onto a rocky ridge, with wonderful views of Gaurishankar just above the Rolwaling Valley. From the top of the ridge, we’ll descend gradually to Rolwaling Khola and finally to Dovan.\nWe’ll travel along the Rolwaling Khola’s bank after leaving Dovan. We take a trek through a lush forest of rhododendron and pine trees, with spectacular views of Gaurishankar. We will slowly ascend to an open region where the Sherpa settlement of Beding is located after crossing the suspension bridge.\nWe’ll have a short and easy trekking day today. We’ll make an easy gradient through the fir trees from Beding. We continue our trip to Na Village as the valley gets broader and flatter. Na is a dispersed settlement with numerous tea places and decent camping opportunities.\nAcclimatization is critical at higher elevations. As a result, we’ll rest for a day at Na Village to acclimate. Furthermore, Na offers a few good day hikes. We can travel up the valley to a little Kharka and then follow the trail to Yalung Peak Base Camp, which takes about five hours round trip. Alternatively, we can hike to the end of Tsho Rolpa Lake for views of Kang Nachago above Na, which will take four hours.\nOur hike begins with a steady ascent to a bridge across the Tsho Rolpa outflow. We take the main trail to the south, which ascends an ablation valley. We travel past Chhukyima on the route, where there are a couple of tea shops run by Na Village residents.

    "content": "This magnificent Tilicho lake trekking leads you to the fine village inhabited by a wide diversity of people from different ethnic groups, offering spectacular and majestic views of the white Himalayas. You will discover the ever changing landscapes of this lovely land, as you trek through the Annapurna region-an area of Nepal. Green subtropical forests filled with life are sights that you will come across, then beautiful terraced farms around which locals grow their crops, and finally, high mountain deserts with rocky terrain reminiscent of the moon around glaciers.\nThis magnificent Tilicho lake trekking leads you to the fine village inhabited by a wide diversity of people from different ethnic groups, offering spectacular and majestic views of the white Himalayas. You will discover the ever-changing landscapes of this lovely land, as you trek through the Annapurna region-an area of Nepal. Green subtropical forests filled with life are sights that you will come across, then beautiful terraced farms around which locals grow their crops, and finally, high mountain deserts with rocky terrain reminiscent of the moon around glaciers. It is at an astounding height of 4,919 meters (16,138 feet) above sea level and so is one of the highest lakes on Earth.\nThis 15 Days trek covers about 100 miles (160 km) in total and usually takes 12–14 days to complete, mixing physical adventure with deep cultural experiences. One of the hardest parts is crossing Thorong La Pass, which sits at a dizzying 5,416 meters (17,769 feet) above sea level—so high that altitude sickness can be a real problem if you don’t take time to adjust. You are going to explore centuries-old monasteries by traveling through the peaceful Manang Valley, visit friendly Gurung and Thakali villagers, and enjoy authentic Himalayan foods like thukpa (an immensely hearty noodle soup) and tsampa (roasted barley flour used in many local meals). The scenery changes almost daily: one moment you’re in the colorful rhododendron forests, and the next you’re crossing wide-open plains where yaks graze in the shadows of snow-covered peaks.\nYour Tilicho Lake Trek adventure begins in Besisahar, which you can reach by a 6–8-hour drive from Kathmandu or by flying to Pokhara and then taking a shorter road trip. From there, the trail slowly climbs through charming villages like Chame and Pisang, where you’ll see traditional stone houses and fluttering prayer flags. Manang is the largest settlement in the area, and it is great for resting and acclimatizing before heading higher. The routes beyond Manang lead to the lonely settlement of Khangsar, perched perilously on steep cliffs, and finally to the Tilicho Base Camp, a small but welcoming respite in the harsh high-altitude environment. The last hike up to Tilicho Lake is steep and tiring, but when you arrive, you’ll be amazed by the view: a bright blue lake, fed by glaciers, sitting quietly between towering mountain walls under the clear Himalayan sky. What makes this Tilicho Lake Standard Trek 15 days so special is the perfect balance between untouched natural beauty and real cultural experiences. Unlike busier hiking routes, Tilicho Lake feels wild and unspoiled, giving you a true sense of adventure. Imagine watching the sunrise paint the mountains pink, standing in complete silence in the high desert, or sharing stories with other trekkers after a long day on the trail. The trek is for experienced trekkers looking for high-altitude challenges and newcomers who want to learn about Himalayan traditions from lodges that provide comfort: it has something incredible to offer you all. More than trekking: travel through possibly the most spectacular scenery on earth with added luxury, which makes the experience so much more pleasurable.\nThere you will be met by our Airport Representative and transferred to the hotel by private tourist vehicle. Overnight at the hotel.\nWe will start our tour with a drive from Kathmandu to Besi Shahar, which is the headquarters of the western Nepali district of Lamjung. The drive takes us through the Prithvi highway up to Dumre. The Prithvi highway runs parallel to the Trishuli river for the most part. Once we cross the Nagdhunga pass, we will see a wide and fertile Naubise valley on one side and the Kathmandu valley on the other. The Naubise valley is enriched by the Naubise river, which meets with the Trishuli river near the Galchi. Once we cross Galchi, the dark green Trishuli river is our companion along with beautiful villages and occasional towns. Most of the area around the highway is covered in dense forests of the Mahabharata hills, along the side of which the highway runs. We will leave the Trishuli river from Muglin, which flows south towards Chitwan and later becomes Narayani as it is joined by Kali Gandaki and Seti, and head on our path towards Besisahar. We will take the route to Pokhara from Mugling up to Dumre,The section of the highway goes along the bank of the Marsyangdi River. We will leave the Prithvi highway from Dumre and head northwards along the Marsyangdi River to Besisahar. The drive is a joyride because we will have the beautiful Marsyangdi river to our right and the stunning Himalayan peaks at our front all along the journey. We will stay at a guest house in Besisahar for the night. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner plans are included in today’s part of the trek.\nWe will start our tour with a drive from Kathmandu to Besi Shahar, which is the headquarters of the western Nepali district of Lamjung.

From Chyamje village, the journey continues along the Marsyangdi River, crossing to its eastern bank before winding through a dense forest. Along the way, breathtaking views of the majestic Annapurna and Manaslu ranges unfold. The trail then opens onto a wide path leading to the charming village of Tal Besi. After a refreshing break here, the drive resumes for a few more hours, finally arriving at Chame for an overnight stay.\nFrom Chyamje village, the journey continues along the Marsyangdi River, crossing to its eastern bank before winding through a dense forest.

After we walk for an hour, the road starts to get more rocky and steep. The walking trail creeps through high mountain slopes with a sharp fall below to the foot of the river. We will come across the village of Barthang (2,950 m) on our way and rest there for a while. We will get a glorious view of Annapurna II and Pisang Peak (6,091 m) as we move further along from Barthang. Many monasteries and stupas lie on our way as we get near to the village of Pisang. We will cross a bridge near the lower Pisang and move towards the central part of the villages. Mani walls and prayer flags adorn our path throughout the village.

We will cross the Jarshing river via a suspension bridge after walking for a short while from Manang. The path ahead goes through the slopes of the Gangapurna mountain. We will also get a stunning view of the Pisang peak. We will walk slowly along the slopes because a deep ravine will follow us for the most part of the journey.\nWe will come across a monastery as we move a little ahead of the village of Khangasar. As we pass further ahead, we will come across many pasture lands. These pastures are used for rearing animals like Yak and Chyangra, which is Himalayan goat. We will get a clear view of the wide valley ahead of us as we move further up from Khangsar. The Khangsar river also follows us for most of our journey and we will walk along its cliffs. This part of the trek is famous for crystals. You will see sparkling crystals in the path as we are about to reach Tilicho Lake Base Camp. The last part of the trek takes us through the level path of the valley into the area where the base camp is located. We will stay at a guest house in base camp for the night.

We will be going to an altitude of around 5,000 m for the first time during our trek so we will walk slowly. The first part of the trek is a steep and long climb up to the altitude of 4,750 m. The spot at the end of this long climb reveals the wonderful view of Tarke Gyang, Gangapurna, and the Khangsar Kang. Tilicho Lake, which is arguably the highest lake in the world, is a dark blue lake situated in the lap of the glorious Himalayas. The water of the lake is however often frozen, and it is possible to cross the lake on foot during peak winter. We will spend some time at Tilicho lake and get back towards the base camp. The descent is relatively easier than the climb, but slippery mountain slopes can add misery to our already beaten up body so we must tread slowly and carefully.\nWe will start our trek to Tilicho lake after early morning breakfast.

There are many yak grazing pastures near the village of Yak Kharka which is also famous for Yak products including cheese. Our road from Tilicho Lake Base Camp first leads us out of the Marsyangdi river valley and then takes us to the beautiful village of Tenki Manang. The village is made up of closely clustered traditional houses. We will then walk nearby the village of Khangsar. There is a path in a slope 500 m above Khangsar. We will take this path and continue on our journey forward. We will come across Jarshang Khola and cross it via a suspension bridge. This part has even fewer trees compared to the Marsyangdi valley but the breathtaking view of the Himalayas, including the Tilicho Peak (7,134 m), Khatungkang (6,484 m), and Chulu Peak (6,584 m) as we near Yak Kharka compensates for the lack of trees. We will be welcomed by herds of yak upon green grasslands as we reach Yak Kharka.\nOur destination for today is the village of Yak Kharka, which means Yak grazing pasture.

Thorung Phedi is also known as Thorong High Camp and is located at the base of the Thorong La Pass. We will come across the village of Ledar after a short trek from Yak Kharka. We will rest for a bit at Ledar and continue on a trail that passes through the cliffs of the Jarshang River. We will cross the Jarshang River via a wooden bridge and continue to enter further deep into the heart of the mountain peaks which by now encircle us from all sides. Right, when we are about to reach Thorung Phedi we will get a spectacular view of mountains like Thorung Peak (6,144 m), Syagang Peak (6,026 m), Khatungkang Peak (6,484 m), Purbung Himal (6,590 m), and other surrounding mountains. If we are lucky then we can also spot the Himalayan Blue Ship at this altitude. We will stay at a guest house in Thorung Phedi.

We will take an early rest because tomorrow’s part of the trek is the most challenging one.\nWe will conquer the Thorong La Pass today. Thorung La Pass is one of the high Himalayan passes of Nepal and one of the most challenging ones to conquer. The road to Thorong La Pass is difficult because we will have to walk along the glacial moraines. The moraines are slippery and often abound with sharp crevasses. We will have to reach Thorung La Pass before mid-day because a strong wind blows during this time around the pass.which connects the district of Manang with the district of Mustang. We will head towards Muktinath after spending some time at the Thorong La Pass. Muktinath is a famous temple of the Hindus. There are 108 taps of water in the Muktinath Temple, bathing upon which Hindus believe will wash away your sins. The goddess Jwala Mai temple is also located near Muktinath. We will stay at a guest house in Muktinath for the night after a long hard day of the trek.

It’s essential that our guests let us know their dietary needs prior to joining the trip: if you are on a special diet or vegetarian or a diet advised by your doctor, our cooks will know how to take care of you. We ensure you get king size meals, especially at breakfast as per your body needs. Special care is taken when you are on the trails. We know food is important to get you into the holiday groove.\nWe understand – Holidays are a big decision. It’s not always you jet across the globe to wander the souks of turkey or bask in a dreamy Poonhill sunrise. But we’ve been doing this every day for over two decades (we’re now graying). Our confidence has now turned bold because we know so well what our guests truly want: a fine mix of extensions after a trek and enough time to chill out, a combo of unique tours and local hideaways you won’t find on Google. And surely some original real life experiences in Nepal, the land of the Himalaya…and the gods. We have a heady mix of treks, tours and adventure trips to suit both greenhorns and ‘done-it-all” travelers. Your itineraries are tailored to match your time, budget and the joys of travel: from two days or two months. The options are juicy, from shoe string budgets to high end luxury tours. We suggest you hike through narrow rugged mountain paths into dense rhododendron forests, lush glens and chocolate box villages where the friendly natives warmly welcome you from the heart. There’s never a dull moment in Nepal.\nWe understand – Holidays are a big decision. It’s not always you jet across the globe to wander the souks of turkey or bask in a dreamy Poonhill sunrise.
